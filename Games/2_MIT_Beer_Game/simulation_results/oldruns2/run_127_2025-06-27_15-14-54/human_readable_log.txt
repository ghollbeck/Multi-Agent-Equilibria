--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of inventory is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $5.00, and I have 40 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round so we can adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a steady supply chain flow.
  Information Shared: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of inventory is crucial for all of us. I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the need for coordination to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a steady flow of inventory is crucial for all of us to maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and align our orders accordingly to avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $5.00, and I have 40 units in inventory with no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. We must be cautious of stockouts and oversupply, as these can destabilize our supply chain and hurt everyone's profits. Remember, I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so let's plan accordingly to maintain a steady flow and avoid unnecessary costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.

I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round to align our production schedules and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain steady production to meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to maintain a steady supply chain flow.
  Information Shared: I currently have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of inventory is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $5.00, and I have 40 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and ensure we can meet customer demand. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round so we can adjust our orders accordingly and maintain a steady supply chain flow.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects the recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent any stockouts or oversupply in the chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 28 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit so far is $21.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders closely to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for clear communication on expected orders to avoid fluctuations that could threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a balanced inventory while fulfilling orders to minimize costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 8 units in inventory and no backlog, with a total profit of $81.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for clear communication on expected orders to avoid fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent stockouts and manage our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on fulfilling the current backlog while considering future demand to maintain stability.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units, with a total profit of $87.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to prevent stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for clear communication on expected orders to avoid fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production with the current backlog of 10 units and the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while being cautious of oversupply, as I currently have 0 units in inventory. This will help us avoid stockouts and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production to meet the current backlog and anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our total supply chain profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 28 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 8 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that reflects the recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can prevent any stockouts or oversupply in the chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of coordinating orders closely to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the need for clear communication on expected orders to avoid fluctuations that could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to ensure we can meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for clear communication on expected orders to avoid fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent stockouts and manage our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to ensure we all remain profitable and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders closely to prevent stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the need for clear communication on expected orders to avoid fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production with the current backlog of 10 units and the recent demand trends. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the expected demand while being cautious of oversupply, as I currently have 0 units in inventory. This will help us avoid stockouts and maintain stability in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to maximize our total supply chain profits.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer to meet potential future demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring steady supply chain flow.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 27 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. My total profit so far is $35.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts to prevent stockouts and manage our backlogs efficiently. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady supply chain flow.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders with the Retailer to prevent stockouts and manage my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication channel to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to coordinate our orders better and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. My total profit so far is $118.50, and I am concerned about the impact of stockouts on my profit trajectory.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning forecasts to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will be transparent about my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. I am currently at a profit of $64.00, but this could be jeopardized if we do not align our orders. I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to coordinate our orders better and maintain a steady supply chain flow. This will help us all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse due to stockouts or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on transparency and collaboration to optimize our orders and prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning forecasts to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our production and orders to avoid stockouts and maintain profitability across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog of 22 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent future shortages.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning production with current backlog and expected demand to stabilize the supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [18]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring steady supply chain flow.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts to prevent stockouts and manage our backlogs efficiently. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication channel to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to coordinate our orders better and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning forecasts to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will be transparent about my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. I am currently at a profit of $64.00, but this could be jeopardized if we do not align our orders. I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to coordinate our orders better and maintain a steady supply chain flow. This will help us all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse due to stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning forecasts to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our production and orders to avoid stockouts and maintain profitability across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog of 22 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent future shortages.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to coordinate our orders better and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring steady supply chain flow.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 32 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 32, 18]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 32
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (32 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning orders to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Therefore, I will be ordering 20 units this round to prepare for the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts more openly to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring steady supply chain flow.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our forecasts to prevent stockouts and manage our backlogs efficiently. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication channel to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to coordinate our orders better and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning forecasts to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will be transparent about my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. I am currently at a profit of $64.00, but this could be jeopardized if we do not align our orders. I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to coordinate our orders better and maintain a steady supply chain flow. This will help us all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse due to stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning forecasts to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our production and orders to avoid stockouts and maintain profitability across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog of 22 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent future shortages.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to coordinate our orders better and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring steady supply chain flow.

Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and maintain a steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication channel to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to coordinate our orders better and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning forecasts to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our orders and avoid the bullwhip effect, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will be transparent about my current situation: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders. I am currently at a profit of $64.00, but this could be jeopardized if we do not align our orders. I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to coordinate our orders better and maintain a steady supply chain flow. This will help us all maximize our profits and prevent any potential market collapse due to stockouts or oversupply.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our expected demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet customer demand without excess inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning forecasts to prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to optimize our production and orders to avoid stockouts and maintain profitability across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production to meet the current backlog of 22 units while considering the recent demand trends to prevent future shortages.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 47 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 11 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 11, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 47 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all stages of the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy to balance our inventory levels and meet customer demand efficiently.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all stages of the supply chain. My current inventory is 11 units with no backlog, and my profit so far is $185.50. I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could threaten my profit trajectory. To maintain stability, I propose we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our ordering strategies together.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 41 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 18, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [100]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (41 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 47 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all stages of the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy to balance our inventory levels and meet customer demand efficiently.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all stages of the supply chain. My current inventory is 11 units with no backlog, and my profit so far is $185.50. I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could threaten my profit trajectory. To maintain stability, I propose we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our ordering strategies together.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 41 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to synchronize our orders and share our inventory levels to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring profitability for all stages of the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Distributor highlighted the urgency of their situation with a backlog of 41 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units. Therefore, I will propose that we synchronize our production schedules and share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring profitability for all stages of the supply chain.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 10, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [52]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 42
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 47 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all stages of the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a more synchronized ordering strategy to balance our inventory levels and meet customer demand efficiently.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure profitability for all stages of the supply chain. My current inventory is 11 units with no backlog, and my profit so far is $185.50. I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could threaten my profit trajectory. To maintain stability, I propose we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our ordering strategies together.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without creating excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and avoid stockouts, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 41 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our ordering strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to synchronize our orders and share our inventory levels to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring profitability for all stages of the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect, and Distributor highlighted the urgency of their situation with a backlog of 41 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 12 units. Therefore, I will propose that we synchronize our production schedules and share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to optimize our strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 54 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and keep the supply chain stable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $42.00, and I have 54 units in inventory with no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all remain profitable. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply chain flow.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared expected demand to minimize costs and maximize profits.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to keep the supply chain stable and profitable for everyone.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $223.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 10 units, which highlights the need for careful planning to avoid stockouts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 54 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 12, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 44 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [18, 29, 21]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [74]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 70
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (44 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 38 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 40, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [68]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (38 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 54 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand. However, I hear that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand more transparently to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and keep the supply chain stable.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we all remain profitable. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand transparently and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady supply chain flow.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to keep the supply chain stable and profitable for everyone.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our orders based on shared expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products through the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain profitability for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to keep the supply chain stable and profitable for everyone.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of aligning our orders based on shared expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products through the supply chain. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 38 units, which puts me in a vulnerable position. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next rounds and adjust our orders accordingly to prevent the bullwhip effect and maintain profitability for all of us. My current profit is $492.00, and I am concerned that if we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stockouts and oversupply, which could hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to keep the supply chain stable and profitable for everyone.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 75 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [94]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent disruptions in the supply chain. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current backlog of 106 units and zero inventory, we are at risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a balanced flow of products and maximize our collective profits.

I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of aligning our order quantities to maintain steady inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that with my current backlog of 106 units and zero inventory, we are at risk of stockouts if we do not align our production and ordering strategies. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round and adjust our orders accordingly to ensure a balanced flow of products and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 106 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 30, 94]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [200]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 68
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (106 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 96 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-23.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of accurate demand forecasting and suggest we share our expected demand to align our orders better.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain steady inventory levels and maximize profits.
  Information Shared: I have 96 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $-23.50.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and suggested we coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to optimize our inventory and profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $333.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are not over-ordering or under-ordering, which could lead to instability in the supply chain. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs and oversupply, as these could threaten our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so planning is crucial.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 96 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 20 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 8, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 96 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-23.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of accurate demand forecasting and suggest we share our expected demand to align our orders better.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain steady inventory levels and maximize profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and suggested we coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to optimize our inventory and profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $333.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are not over-ordering or under-ordering, which could lead to instability in the supply chain. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs and oversupply, as these could threaten our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so planning is crucial.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about aligning expected demand to optimize inventory and profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are all on the same page and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 48 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $399.50. I propose we all communicate our expected demand to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our collective profits while being cautious of potential stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's concerns about aligning expected demand to optimize inventory and profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our production levels to avoid creating excess backlog or stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are aligned and can maintain steady inventory levels, which is crucial for maximizing our collective profits and preventing any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 48 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 30, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [136]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 96 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-23.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of accurate demand forecasting and suggest we share our expected demand to align our orders better.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain steady inventory levels and maximize profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and suggested we coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to optimize our inventory and profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $333.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are not over-ordering or under-ordering, which could lead to instability in the supply chain. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs and oversupply, as these could threaten our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so planning is crucial.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about aligning expected demand to optimize inventory and profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are all on the same page and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 48 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $399.50. I propose we all communicate our expected demand to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our collective profits while being cautious of potential stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's concerns about aligning expected demand to optimize inventory and profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our production levels to avoid creating excess backlog or stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are aligned and can maintain steady inventory levels, which is crucial for maximizing our collective profits and preventing any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (32 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 96 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-23.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent any oversupply or stock-outs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of accurate demand forecasting and suggest we share our expected demand to align our orders better.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us all maintain steady inventory levels and maximize profits.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of maintaining steady inventory levels to avoid stock-outs and suggested we coordinate our orders to prevent oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expected demand to optimize our inventory and profits. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 20 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $333.00. I propose we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are not over-ordering or under-ordering, which could lead to instability in the supply chain. We must be cautious of potential stock-outs and oversupply, as these could threaten our profits. Remember, I can only ship the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog, so planning is crucial.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler's concern about aligning expected demand to optimize inventory and profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are all on the same page and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 48 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $399.50. I propose we all communicate our expected demand to maintain steady inventory levels and maximize our collective profits while being cautious of potential stock-outs and oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's concerns about aligning expected demand to optimize inventory and profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our production levels to avoid creating excess backlog or stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 32 units. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are aligned and can maintain steady inventory levels, which is crucial for maximizing our collective profits and preventing any market instability.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our expected demand for the next round to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 113 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 0, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I currently have 113 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-47.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our expected demand more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 81 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $375.00. I propose we all align our orders based on expected demand to prevent any potential market collapse and ensure we maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 0, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 87 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 20, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [105]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 113 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-47.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our expected demand more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 81 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $375.00. I propose we all align our orders based on expected demand to prevent any potential market collapse and ensure we maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand for the next round to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of supply and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on our expected demand for the next round to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand. Distributor also proposed sharing expected demand to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our production aligns with actual demand to prevent any potential market collapse. Therefore, I will maintain steady production to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 241 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [94, 32, 53]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 64
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 113 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-47.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stockouts or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining a steady flow of orders is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our expected demand more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 81 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $375.00. I propose we all align our orders based on expected demand to prevent any potential market collapse and ensure we maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize profits.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must share our expected demand for the next round to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we all communicate our expected demand and order quantities to ensure we maintain a steady flow of supply and prevent any potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's align our orders based on our expected demand for the next round to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of aligning our expected demand. Distributor also proposed sharing expected demand to stabilize the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure our production aligns with actual demand to prevent any potential market collapse. Therefore, I will maintain steady production to meet expected demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels to avoid excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production and orders to stabilize the supply chain and maximize our total profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 120 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-75.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 120 units in inventory and no backlog, and my current profit is $-75.00.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $396.50, and I have 87 units in inventory with no backlog. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or excess inventory, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining my inventory while coordinating with others to prevent fluctuations.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. I currently have 177 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $515.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain efforts while maximizing our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining my inventory while coordinating with others to prevent fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 120 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 177 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [20, 33, 26]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [76]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 293 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 53, 46]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [46]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 53
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 120 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $-75.00, which is concerning. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $396.50, and I have 87 units in inventory with no backlog. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs or excess inventory, which could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. I currently have 177 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $515.00. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain efforts while maximizing our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment about aligning our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production schedules to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect. I currently have 293 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $1040.50. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our production and maintain profitability across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy for our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize our supply chain and maximize total profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 140 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-112.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and suggest that we all share our expected demand to align our orders better.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on observed demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I have 140 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is currently $-112.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 107 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while minimizing costs. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could lead to excess inventory or backlog. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders better and maximize our total profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders to maintain a balance between inventory and backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid excess inventory or stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I have 107 units in inventory and no backlog, and my total profit is currently $425.50.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 140 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 107 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 140 units in inventory and no backlog. My total profit so far is $-112.50, which is concerning. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and suggest that we all share our expected demand to align our orders better.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. I currently have 107 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill expected demand while minimizing costs. However, I am concerned about potential fluctuations in orders that could lead to excess inventory or backlog. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders better and maximize our total profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can adjust our orders accordingly and avoid excess inventory or stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and Wholesaler echoed the need for effective coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 229 units and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of planning our orders carefully to avoid stockouts or excess inventory that could hurt our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs and ensure customer satisfaction, and Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for effective coordination to prevent the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to stabilize our supply chain and maximize profits. Therefore, I will maintain steady production to meet expected demand while ensuring we do not oversupply, as I currently have 320 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows for flexibility in production.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next rounds and coordinate our production and orders to prevent stock-outs and excess inventory.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 320 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [53, 46, 53]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 46
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($1078.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (320 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.
