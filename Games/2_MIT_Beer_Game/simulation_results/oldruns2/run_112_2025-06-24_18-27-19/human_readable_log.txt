--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed a recent demand of 9 units, which may indicate a potential increase in demand. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain sufficient stock.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 9 units and plan to order 20 units to maintain sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about potential demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will also order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory to meet expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they observed a recent demand of 9 units and plan to order 20 units to maintain sufficient stock. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment with a similar order. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for potential demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I have enough inventory to meet expected demand while monitoring our stock levels closely.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all mention a recent demand of 9 units and their plans to order 20 units to maintain sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all anticipating a potential increase in demand. However, I believe we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "Demand may fluctuate, leading to potential backlog if not enough stock is ordered.",

  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 9 units, which may indicate a potential increase in demand. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Coordination in our ordering could help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that the recent demand from the Retailer is 9 units, which may indicate a stable demand pattern. However, I have not received any updates from other agents yet. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to cover expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively low, with only 9 units ordered. This suggests a potential for increased demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will be cautious in my ordering to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for possible spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed a recent demand of 9 units, which may indicate a potential increase in demand. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts. Coordination in our ordering could help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders better.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that the recent demand from the Retailer is 9 units, which may indicate a stable demand pattern. However, I have not received any updates from other agents yet. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to cover expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively low, with only 9 units ordered. This suggests a potential for increased demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will be cautious in my ordering to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for possible spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 113 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -11.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed consistent demand of 9 units in the last rounds. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and reduce the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations, we can better manage our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand is increasing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough inventory to meet this demand while minimizing backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to balance supply and demand while keeping an eye on trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 72 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 54.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "To maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations and avoid backlog costs, I will order enough to cover expected demand and maintain inventory.",
  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of over-ordering if demand decreases unexpectedly, leading to higher holding costs.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed consistent demand of 9 units in the last rounds. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and reduce the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations, we can better manage our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand is increasing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough inventory to meet this demand while minimizing backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to balance supply and demand while keeping an eye on trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 52 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 39]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 49.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed consistent demand of 9 units in the last rounds. I suggest we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and reduce the bullwhip effect. If we can align our expectations, we can better manage our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand is increasing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for higher orders in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we have enough inventory to meet this demand while minimizing backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to balance supply and demand while keeping an eye on trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential fluctuations in orders. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a peak of 52 units. This suggests potential volatility in future orders. I recommend that we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Coordination in our ordering could help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain decisions.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 49 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [52]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 64.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a peak of 52 units. This suggests potential volatility in future orders. I recommend that we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Coordination in our ordering could help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain decisions.

          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a peak of 52 units. This suggests potential volatility in future orders. I recommend that we all monitor our inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Coordination in our ordering could help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our order quantities and demand forecasts to better align our supply chain decisions.

--------------------- Round 4 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [29, 39, 59, 59]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 to 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory or backlog. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 146 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory or backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing our expected demand can help us align our orders effectively. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock and prepare for potential demand spikes, while also suggesting we share our expected demand for the next round.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 63 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to upcoming demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory or backlog. I also note that Wholesaler agrees with this approach. Based on this, my conclusion is that sharing our expected demand can help us align our orders effectively and reduce the risk of overstocking. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock while preparing for potential demand spikes, as I currently have 61 units in inventory and no backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
  Information Shared: I currently have 61 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our expected demand to optimize our ordering process. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I have enough stock while preparing for potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain stock and prepare for potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our ordering process.
  Information Shared: I currently have 4 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to upcoming demand effectively.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 146 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [22]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: -2.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 to 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 12 units. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with orders of 29, 32, and 22 units. I hear that maintaining a steady supply is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to ensure we all have sufficient stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with significant variations. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my order to prepare for potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 61 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 32, 22]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [64]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 42.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 to 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with a peak of 12 units. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. This could help reduce holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with orders of 29, 32, and 22 units. I hear that maintaining a steady supply is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to ensure we all have sufficient stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with significant variations. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my order to prepare for potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with orders of 29, 32, and 22 units. I hear that maintaining a steady supply is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand trends. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to ensure we all have sufficient stock.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with significant variations. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my order to prepare for potential spikes in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 5 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [32, 52, 72, 82]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 and 12 units. I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to avoid backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to prepare for potential increases in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining stock levels to meet expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next few rounds to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 176 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are ordering 20 units to prepare for potential increases in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better match the expected demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain a buffer against fluctuations while considering the Retailer's strategy.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on aligning my orders with expected demand to optimize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand for the next few rounds to coordinate our orders effectively and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 96 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to the expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to prepare for potential increases in demand, and the Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all anticipating similar demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels while aligning with the expected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining stock levels to meet expected demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we continue sharing our expected demand for the next few rounds to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 94 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to respond to the expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 20 units to prepare for potential increases in demand, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this by also planning to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all anticipating similar demand patterns. However, I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, and I believe we should be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units this round to align with the expected demand while maintaining a buffer for fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on aligning my order with the expected demand while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we continue sharing our expected demand for the next few rounds to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 31 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to the expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 176 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -40.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 and 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with the last three orders being 12, 7, and 7 units. This suggests a potential decrease in demand. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a peak at 32 units. This suggests we may need to be cautious about over-ordering. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with significant orders in the last rounds. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to handle potential spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order conservatively to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 96 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 28.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 and 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with the last three orders being 12, 7, and 7 units. This suggests a potential decrease in demand. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a peak at 32 units. This suggests we may need to be cautious about over-ordering. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with significant orders in the last rounds. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to handle potential spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order conservatively to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 31 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [52, 34, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: 145.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 7 and 12 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory. I suggest we share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with the last three orders being 12, 7, and 7 units. This suggests a potential decrease in demand. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with a peak at 32 units. This suggests we may need to be cautious about over-ordering. I recommend we coordinate our orders to better match demand and avoid excess inventory.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with significant orders in the last rounds. I hear that maintaining a buffer is crucial to handle potential spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to order conservatively to maintain a buffer while monitoring demand closely.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler mentioned optimizing orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider the recent demand patterns to better manage our inventory levels and avoid overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to cover expected demand while keeping a buffer for potential spikes.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 105 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid stockouts, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed the need for optimizing orders based on recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider the recent demand fluctuations to better manage our inventory levels. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my order to prepare for potential spikes in demand while being mindful of holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand patterns while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet fluctuations.

        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with the last three orders being 7, 7, and 13 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for possible spikes in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with orders ranging from 19 to 33 units. This variability can lead to challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to maintain a balance.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better coordinate our orders.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 34, 31, and 53 units. This indicates potential variability in demand. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 105 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [22, 19, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 53.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain stock while anticipating potential demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of over-ordering if demand fluctuates unexpectedly, leading to higher holding costs.",

  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to prepare for potential demand spikes while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with the last three orders being 7, 7, and 13 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for possible spikes in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with orders ranging from 19 to 33 units. This variability can lead to challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to maintain a balance.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts for the next few rounds to better coordinate our orders.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 34, 31, and 53 units. This indicates potential variability in demand. I suggest we coordinate our orders to better match this demand and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [19, 31, 61, 67]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 214 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will order based on the recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order enough to cover expected demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 98 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to upcoming demand effectively.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer and Wholesaler both emphasized the importance of maintaining optimal inventory levels to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking while still being responsive to demand. Therefore, I will order conservatively to maintain my inventory without risking excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 121 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to respond to upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all emphasized the importance of maintaining optimal inventory levels to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders while still being responsive to demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential demand increases while being mindful of overstocking.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively while keeping a buffer for potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 51 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to respond to upcoming demand effectively.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 214 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -37.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better align with the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data to better forecast future orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 19, 33, and 30 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 31, 53, and 50 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order strategy to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand without incurring high holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better align with the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data to better forecast future orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 19, 33, and 30 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 31, 53, and 50 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order strategy to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand without incurring high holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 121 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [19, 33, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [75]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: 45.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 51 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 53, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: 95.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to avoid backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better align with the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data to better forecast future orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 19, 33, and 30 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 31, 53, and 50 units. This suggests variability in demand that we should account for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order strategy to ensure we can meet potential spikes in demand without incurring high holding costs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to maintain my stock levels and prepare for any fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain a balanced supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will be cautious with my next order to maintain a balance between inventory and demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders around 50 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any fluctuations in demand.

        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 120 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 51.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively stable, with numbers around 10 to 13 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and potential stockouts. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to maintain my stock levels and prepare for any fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain a balanced supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will be cautious with my next order to maintain a balance between inventory and demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders around 50 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will be cautious with my next order to maintain a balance between inventory and demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders around 50 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 73 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [53, 50, 51]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [51]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: 119.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that our recent demand has been relatively stable, with numbers around 10 to 13 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and potential stockouts. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to maintain my stock levels and prepare for any fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain a balanced supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will be cautious with my next order to maintain a balance between inventory and demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable, with orders around 50 units. This suggests a potential for consistent demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid overstocking and reduce holding costs. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate any fluctuations in demand.

--------------------- Round 9 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [30, 50, 75, 90]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all consider recent demand trends to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure we have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand patterns while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 272 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and maintaining order quantities to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor recent demand trends to align our orders effectively. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better match the expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid backlogs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand patterns while maintaining a safety stock.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 272 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -72.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet potential demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with observed demand patterns to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 30 and 33 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 201 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 31, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [75]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -25.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet potential demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to align with observed demand patterns to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends to maintain balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 30 and 33 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we maintain sufficient stock to meet this demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory to accommodate potential spikes in demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

--------------------- Round 10 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 14
Shipments received per agent: [31, 51, 81, 102]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating between 11 and 14 units. I believe we should coordinate our orders to better match this demand and avoid excess inventory or backlog. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to maintain stock levels and prepare for potential increases in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet potential demand spikes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 296 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will be placing an order of 20 units to maintain stock levels and prepare for potential increases in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align more closely with the recent demand trends and maintain a buffer without overextending our inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand patterns while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 146 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will be placing an order of 20 units to maintain stock levels and prepare for potential increases in demand. I also note that the Wholesaler is adjusting their order to align more closely with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for potential demand spikes. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain my inventory levels without risking excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively while monitoring demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 238 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well for the upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will be placing an order of 20 units to maintain stock levels and prepare for potential increases in demand. I also note that the Wholesaler and Distributor are adjusting their orders to align closely with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory while still preparing for potential demand spikes. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain a buffer without risking excess stock.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively while monitoring demand trends.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 296 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -74.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders better.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing, with the last three orders being 11, 13, and 14 units. I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to avoid backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we meet the rising demand. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing slightly, with orders of 31, 33, and 34 units. This trend suggests a potential rise in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand without causing stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating, which could impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 146 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 13, 14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 35.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "To maintain a buffer against potential demand fluctuations and avoid backlog costs, I will order enough to cover expected demand and maintain inventory.",
  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of over-ordering if demand decreases unexpectedly, leading to higher holding costs.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders better.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing, with the last three orders being 11, 13, and 14 units. I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to avoid backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we meet the rising demand. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing slightly, with orders of 31, 33, and 34 units. This trend suggests a potential rise in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand without causing stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating, which could impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 147 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [51, 45, 54]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: 85.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all share our recent demand data to improve our predictions. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders accordingly to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our orders better.
- Wholesaler: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing, with the last three orders being 11, 13, and 14 units. I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial to avoid backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while ensuring we meet the rising demand. Therefore, I will continue to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts.
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been increasing slightly, with orders of 31, 33, and 34 units. This trend suggests a potential rise in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand without causing stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that the recent demand has been fluctuating, which could impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order this round to ensure we have enough stock without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.
