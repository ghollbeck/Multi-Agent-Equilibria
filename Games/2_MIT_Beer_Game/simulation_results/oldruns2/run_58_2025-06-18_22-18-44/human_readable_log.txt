--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that our recent demand has been stable, with a single order of 8 units. I believe this indicates a potential for consistent demand in the upcoming rounds. However, I also recognize that fluctuations may occur, which could lead to a backlog if not managed properly. I suggest we all keep our inventory levels in sync to avoid overreacting to demand changes, which can exacerbate the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 50 units to maintain a buffer while meeting expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly update on our inventory and demand forecasts to align our order quantities better.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 102 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet the expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they observed stable demand with a single order of 8 units and suggested we keep our inventory levels in sync to avoid exacerbating the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a buffer is vital, but we should also be cautious of overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to align with my expected demand while ensuring I have enough inventory to meet fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain a balance between supply and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we have weekly updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 102 units in inventory, which positions me to meet the expected demand while allowing for some buffer.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they observed stable demand with a single order of 8 units and suggested we keep our inventory levels in sync to avoid exacerbating the bullwhip effect. I also heard the Wholesaler plan to order 20 units to align with their expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all recognizing the importance of maintaining appropriate inventory levels to meet fluctuations while avoiding overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain my current inventory strategy while aligning with expected demand to mitigate risks.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly update system for inventory and demand forecasts to improve our coordination.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 102 units in inventory and no backlog. I expect demand to rise to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer emphasized the importance of synchronizing our inventory levels to avoid the bullwhip effect. I also noted Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 20 units each to align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the potential for fluctuations in demand and the need for coordination. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to remain aligned with the expected demand while ensuring I have sufficient inventory to meet fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 20 units to maintain a balance between supply and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue to have weekly updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 102 units in inventory and expect a demand increase to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler, Distributor, and Factory all acknowledged the importance of synchronizing our inventory to avoid the bullwhip effect and each plan to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all on the same page regarding maintaining inventory levels to meet anticipated demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units to ensure I can cover the expected demand while also providing a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order 50 units to maintain a buffer while meeting expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly update to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will help us all align our orders more effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 102 units in inventory, which positions me well to meet demand while allowing for fluctuations.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they plan to order 50 units to maintain a buffer, while acknowledging our collective efforts to synchronize inventory levels. I also noted Distributor and Factory plan to order 20 units each to align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of maintaining adequate inventory while preparing for potential demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will proceed with my order of 20 units to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while keeping a sufficient buffer.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to balance supply and demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we continue our weekly updates on inventory and demand forecasts to improve coordination and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 102 units in inventory, which positions me well to meet anticipated demand and fluctuations.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 50 units to maintain a buffer while acknowledging our collective efforts to synchronize inventory levels. I also noted the Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to balance supply and demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the importance of maintaining appropriate inventory levels to meet anticipated demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to align with the expected demand while ensuring I have enough inventory to manage potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain my current inventory strategy while aligning with expected demand to mitigate risks.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue our weekly updates on inventory and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 102 units in inventory and expect demand to rise to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they plan to order 50 units to maintain a buffer while acknowledging our collective efforts to synchronize inventory levels. I also noted that Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 20 units each to align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all recognizing the importance of maintaining adequate inventory, the Retailer's larger order may lead to a strain on the supply chain if demand does not meet expectations. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to align with expected demand while ensuring I do not overextend my inventory capacity.
  Strategy Hint: I will order 20 units to balance supply and demand while managing my inventory levels carefully.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a communication channel for real-time updates on inventory and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 102 units in inventory, which positions me to meet the anticipated demand next round while avoiding excess inventory.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 114, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -28.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I can meet expected demand while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Potential for demand to exceed expectations, leading to stockouts if not managed carefully., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=102, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8], llm_incoming=[8], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. This aligns with my observations of a recent order of 8 units, which seems low compared to my expected demand of 20 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to coordinate better to align our forecasts. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory at 100 units and place an order for 20 units to prepare for anticipated demand, while suggesting a collaborative approach to share demand forecasts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have an inventory of 102 units and have observed a recent demand of 8 units. I hear that the Retailer might be concerned about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to better align with actual demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory levels stable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts with each other to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler is concerned about maintaining inventory levels given the recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely to anticipated demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to maintain sufficient inventory while fulfilling expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more frequently to better synchronize our ordering processes and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I haven't received any communication yet, but I want to share my current situation to promote collaboration. My inventory stands at 102 units, and I've noted a recent demand of 8 units. It's important for us to synchronize our orders to prevent backlog and excess inventory. I believe we should have a clear understanding of each other's expected demands to optimize our supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand for the next rounds, so we can adjust our orders accordingly and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand has been lower than anticipated with only 8 units ordered, which suggests a potential shift in consumer behavior. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels and demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to improve our communication to better align our orders with actual demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level but place an order for 20 units to prepare for expected demand increases in the coming rounds.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed that our recent demand is fluctuating, with a current order of 8 units noted. I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand, which may impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about maintaining sufficient stock while avoiding excess. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet both current and anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]

          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. This aligns with my observations of a recent order of 8 units, which seems low compared to my expected demand of 20 units next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to coordinate better to align our forecasts. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory at 100 units and place an order for 20 units to prepare for anticipated demand, while suggesting a collaborative approach to share demand forecasts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have an inventory of 102 units and have observed a recent demand of 8 units. I hear that the Retailer might be concerned about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to better align with actual demand and avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory levels stable.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts with each other to better align our order quantities and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler is concerned about maintaining inventory levels given the recent demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely to anticipated demand to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to maintain sufficient inventory while fulfilling expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more frequently to better synchronize our ordering processes and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I haven't received any communication yet, but I want to share my current situation to promote collaboration. My inventory stands at 102 units, and I've noted a recent demand of 8 units. It's important for us to synchronize our orders to prevent backlog and excess inventory. I believe we should have a clear understanding of each other's expected demands to optimize our supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our expected demand for the next rounds, so we can adjust our orders accordingly and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have observed that the recent demand has been lower than anticipated with only 8 units ordered, which suggests a potential shift in consumer behavior. I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about inventory levels and demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to improve our communication to better align our orders with actual demand. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level but place an order for 20 units to prepare for expected demand increases in the coming rounds.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have observed that our recent demand is fluctuating, with a current order of 8 units noted. I hear the Retailer mentioned a potential increase in demand, which may impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about maintaining sufficient stock while avoiding excess. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to ensure we can meet both current and anticipated demand without creating a backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help reduce the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 162, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 50, Units sold: 6, Profit: 30.00, Total Profit: -108.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=50, confidence=0.75, rationale=With current inventory, I can fulfill anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Fluctuating demand may lead to increased backlog if not managed carefully., expected_demand_next_round=50, llm_inventory=118, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8, 6], llm_incoming=[26], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 118 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -17.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have noticed recent demand spikes with orders of 8 and 26 units, indicating increased consumption. Coordination among us will be crucial to manage these fluctuations effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is we should communicate more frequently about our inventory levels and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 20 units to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand without incurring backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share forecasts and inventory updates to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that recent orders have varied significantly, with a sudden spike in demand to 46 units. I recommend we closely monitor demand patterns to avoid overreacting to fluctuations. Collaboration on demand forecasts could help stabilize our orders and inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have noted that demand patterns seem to be fluctuating, with recent orders of 8 and 6 units. I believe we need to stay agile and responsive to these changes to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders better to ensure we have sufficient inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place a larger order this round to prepare for expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our projected demand estimates more frequently to align our ordering and reduce fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear there may be fluctuations in demand based on recent orders. It's crucial we maintain transparency to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is we should align our order quantities to reflect actual demand more accurately. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have noticed a significant increase in recent demand, with orders of 8 and 26 units. This suggests potential demand volatility that may impact our inventory levels. Therefore, I suggest we synchronize our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect. I am currently maintaining an inventory of 66 units and plan to order 20 units in anticipation of a consistent demand next round.
  Proposal: Let's consider sharing demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I have not received any updates from other agents yet. However, I want to share that our recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a recent spike to 46 units followed by an order of 20 units. This variability suggests we should closely monitor demand to avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. I recommend that we all communicate our forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let’s establish a regular communication schedule to share our forecasts and orders, aiming for at least bi-weekly updates.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have noticed recent demand spikes with orders of 8 and 26 units, indicating increased consumption. Coordination among us will be crucial to manage these fluctuations effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is we should communicate more frequently about our inventory levels and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 20 units to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand without incurring backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share forecasts and inventory updates to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that recent orders have varied significantly, with a sudden spike in demand to 46 units. I recommend we closely monitor demand patterns to avoid overreacting to fluctuations. Collaboration on demand forecasts could help stabilize our orders and inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have noted that demand patterns seem to be fluctuating, with recent orders of 8 and 6 units. I believe we need to stay agile and responsive to these changes to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders better to ensure we have sufficient inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place a larger order this round to prepare for expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our projected demand estimates more frequently to align our ordering and reduce fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear there may be fluctuations in demand based on recent orders. It's crucial we maintain transparency to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is we should align our order quantities to reflect actual demand more accurately. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have noticed a significant increase in recent demand, with orders of 8 and 26 units. This suggests potential demand volatility that may impact our inventory levels. Therefore, I suggest we synchronize our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect. I am currently maintaining an inventory of 66 units and plan to order 20 units in anticipation of a consistent demand next round.
  Proposal: Let's consider sharing demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I have not received any updates from other agents yet. However, I want to share that our recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a recent spike to 46 units followed by an order of 20 units. This variability suggests we should closely monitor demand to avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. I recommend that we all communicate our forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let’s establish a regular communication schedule to share our forecasts and orders, aiming for at least bi-weekly updates.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share forecasts and inventory updates to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed that recent orders have varied significantly, with a sudden spike in demand to 46 units. I recommend we closely monitor demand patterns to avoid overreacting to fluctuations. Collaboration on demand forecasts could help stabilize our orders and inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have noted that demand patterns seem to be fluctuating, with recent orders of 8 and 6 units. I believe we need to stay agile and responsive to these changes to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders better to ensure we have sufficient inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place a larger order this round to prepare for expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our projected demand estimates more frequently to align our ordering and reduce fluctuations.
- Wholesaler: I hear there may be fluctuations in demand based on recent orders. It's crucial we maintain transparency to avoid excess inventory and backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is we should align our order quantities to reflect actual demand more accurately. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next few rounds to synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I have noticed a significant increase in recent demand, with orders of 8 and 26 units. This suggests potential demand volatility that may impact our inventory levels. Therefore, I suggest we synchronize our order quantities to stabilize our supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect. I am currently maintaining an inventory of 66 units and plan to order 20 units in anticipation of a consistent demand next round.
  Proposal: Let's consider sharing demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I have not received any updates from other agents yet. However, I want to share that our recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a recent spike to 46 units followed by an order of 20 units. This variability suggests we should closely monitor demand to avoid excessive inventory or stockouts. I recommend that we all communicate our forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let’s establish a regular communication schedule to share our forecasts and orders, aiming for at least bi-weekly updates.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 159 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [61]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: -51.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 3 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6, 11]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 222.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear no previous communications from other agents this round, so I want to take this opportunity to share my current inventory situation and demand observations. I have a backlog of 7 units and have seen recent demand orders of 8, 26, and 61 units. This indicates significant fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more closely to avoid excess backlog and inventory issues. Therefore, I will continue to place an order of 20 units to address my backlog while trying to meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our ordering strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I observe that our recent demand has been quite volatile with significant spikes. I believe it's crucial for us to align our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on my current inventory situation, I am prioritizing fulfilling backlogged orders while keeping a close watch on future demand patterns.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that coordination is crucial to manage inventory levels across the supply chain. I've observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 8, 6, and 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining open communication about demand forecasts will help us all manage our inventories more effectively. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and adjust my orders accordingly.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and inventory levels, reducing the risk of stockouts and overstock.
- Wholesaler: I am observing a recent spike in demand with orders of 8, 6, and 11 units. I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is critical to avoid backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to align with these demand trends. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units while remaining flexible to adjust based on the feedback from other agents.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer indicated a significant increase in demand. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand, which has been quite high. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our order quantities to better meet this demand. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to mitigate backlog and prepare for potential increased demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I want to share that I've observed a significant increase in recent demand, with orders of 8, 46, and 74 units. This trend indicates a potential demand surge. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to adjust our strategies to better align with this rising demand to prevent backlogs. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to mitigate my current backlog of 18 units and prepare for potential future orders.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better synchronize our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that other agents have been concerned about demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor recent order patterns to align our strategies. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to help manage my backlog while being mindful of your needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our order quantities and expected demand more frequently to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are focused on adjusting their orders to better match the recent demand patterns. Given the backlog of 32 units I currently have, it's clear that demand is higher than anticipated. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate better to avoid further backlogs in the future. Therefore, I will place a smaller order of 20 units to begin addressing this backlog while avoiding overextension.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more frequently to ensure we are all aligned on expected needs, which can help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with orders of 6, 11, and 11 units. This suggests some inconsistency in consumer behavior. I hear that maintaining a buffer in inventory is crucial to avoiding stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match expected demand and avoid overreacting to spikes in orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to ensure we have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand while also keeping some buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts to align our orders better and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned recent fluctuations in demand. This aligns with the demand patterns I have observed, where we have seen spikes in orders recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to remain vigilant about our inventory levels to avoid a backlog crisis. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to cover the expected demand and mitigate any risks of backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I understand that communication is key to maintaining efficiency in our supply chain. I hear that demand seems to be fluctuating significantly, which can lead to challenges in managing inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our insights on demand trends to align our orders better. Therefore, I will suggest that we establish a shared demand forecasting model to help each of us make informed decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's create a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Recent orders have shown significant variability, with the last three demands being 46, 74, and 66 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our inventory levels to manage this variability. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 32 units to address the current backlog while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to improve our planning and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -9.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (19 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that other agents have been concerned about demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor recent order patterns to align our strategies. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to help manage my backlog while being mindful of your needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our order quantities and expected demand more frequently to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are focused on adjusting their orders to better match the recent demand patterns. Given the backlog of 32 units I currently have, it's clear that demand is higher than anticipated. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate better to avoid further backlogs in the future. Therefore, I will place a smaller order of 20 units to begin addressing this backlog while avoiding overextension.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more frequently to ensure we are all aligned on expected needs, which can help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with orders of 6, 11, and 11 units. This suggests some inconsistency in consumer behavior. I hear that maintaining a buffer in inventory is crucial to avoiding stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match expected demand and avoid overreacting to spikes in orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to ensure we have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand while also keeping some buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts to align our orders better and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned recent fluctuations in demand. This aligns with the demand patterns I have observed, where we have seen spikes in orders recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to remain vigilant about our inventory levels to avoid a backlog crisis. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to cover the expected demand and mitigate any risks of backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I understand that communication is key to maintaining efficiency in our supply chain. I hear that demand seems to be fluctuating significantly, which can lead to challenges in managing inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our insights on demand trends to align our orders better. Therefore, I will suggest that we establish a shared demand forecasting model to help each of us make informed decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's create a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Recent orders have shown significant variability, with the last three demands being 46, 74, and 66 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our inventory levels to manage this variability. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 32 units to address the current backlog while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to improve our planning and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand patterns. Recent orders have shown significant variability, with the last three demands being 46, 74, and 66 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our inventory levels to manage this variability. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 32 units to address the current backlog while being cautious of overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to improve our planning and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 32 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [46, 74, 66]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 64
          - Last round profit: 133.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (32 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that other agents have been concerned about demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor recent order patterns to align our strategies. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to help manage my backlog while being mindful of your needs.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our order quantities and expected demand more frequently to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are focused on adjusting their orders to better match the recent demand patterns. Given the backlog of 32 units I currently have, it's clear that demand is higher than anticipated. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate better to avoid further backlogs in the future. Therefore, I will place a smaller order of 20 units to begin addressing this backlog while avoiding overextension.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more frequently to ensure we are all aligned on expected needs, which can help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with orders of 6, 11, and 11 units. This suggests some inconsistency in consumer behavior. I hear that maintaining a buffer in inventory is crucial to avoiding stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match expected demand and avoid overreacting to spikes in orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to ensure we have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand while also keeping some buffer.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts to align our orders better and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned recent fluctuations in demand. This aligns with the demand patterns I have observed, where we have seen spikes in orders recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to remain vigilant about our inventory levels to avoid a backlog crisis. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to cover the expected demand and mitigate any risks of backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I understand that communication is key to maintaining efficiency in our supply chain. I hear that demand seems to be fluctuating significantly, which can lead to challenges in managing inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our insights on demand trends to align our orders better. Therefore, I will suggest that we establish a shared demand forecasting model to help each of us make informed decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's create a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels.

--------------------- Round 5 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 6
Shipments received per agent: [61, 74, 76, 64]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of aligning our orders to better meet demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our ordering strategies to reduce potential stockouts and backlogs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round to ensure I have enough inventory to meet expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balance between inventory and fulfilling expected demand without creating excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our upcoming order quantities and expected demand to align our efforts and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 210 units in inventory with no backlog, and I'm anticipating a demand of 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are maintaining an order of 50 units to ensure enough inventory to meet expected demand while keeping a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and backlogs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand and avoid increasing my backlog further.
  Strategy Hint: Focusing on aligning order quantities with anticipated demand to minimize backlog and maintain inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our order quantities and demand forecasts more effectively, which will help us all manage our inventories better.

I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned placing an order of 20 units to align with anticipated demand and avoid increasing their backlog. Furthermore, the Distributor stated they will place an order of 20 units to address their backlog situation. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a significant need for us to coordinate our orders to manage our backlogs effectively and optimize our inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to help meet the expected demand while keeping in mind my current backlog of 48 units.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to align my order with the anticipated demand while addressing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared communication channel to regularly update each other on our inventory levels and demand forecasts, helping us to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have zero inventory and a backlog of 48 units, indicating an urgent need for replenishment.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler said they will place an order of 20 units to align with anticipated demand, and the Distributor mentioned a similar order due to their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a collective need for us to accurately forecast and coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and backlogs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 50 units this round, as I believe it will help ensure I have sufficient inventory to meet the expected demand while also providing a buffer to accommodate any unforeseen fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a balance between inventory levels and fulfilling expected demand to ensure stability across the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared communication channel for ongoing updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will help us all manage our inventories better and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 210 units in inventory with no backlog, which positions me well to fulfill demand in the short term.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order of 50 units to ensure enough inventory while providing a buffer. I also hear the Distributor mention a similar order of 20 units to address their backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a strong collective need for us to coordinate our orders to effectively manage our backlogs and optimize inventory levels across the supply chain. I want to emphasize that I currently have a backlog of 51 units which needs immediate attention. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with the anticipated demand while addressing my backlog situation.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to coordinate my orders with expected demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our order quantities and demand forecasts, helping us minimize the bullwhip effect.

Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a collective need for us to align our orders to effectively manage our backlogs and optimize inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round, as it will help address my backlog while aligning with the anticipated demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on coordinating order quantities with anticipated demand to manage backlogs effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for ongoing updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have zero inventory and a backlog of 103 units, indicating an urgent need for replenishment to meet demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order of 50 units to ensure enough inventory, and the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 51 units needing immediate attention. Additionally, the Distributor pointed out their urgency due to a backlog of 103 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant backlogs and need to coordinate our orders effectively to manage our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to address my backlog while aligning with the anticipated demand.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to align my orders with expected demand while addressing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a real-time communication platform to share order quantities and inventory levels, which will help us all manage our inventories better and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have zero inventory and a backlog of 48 units, indicating an urgent need for replenishment.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 210 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [74]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: -22.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed significant demand fluctuations in recent rounds, with the last three demands being 61, 46, and 74 units. This variability can lead to increased backlog, as I currently have 103 units in backlog. I believe better communication about future demand expectations can help us all manage our inventory more effectively. Therefore, I propose that we establish a regular update protocol for demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect and improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our inventory decisions more closely.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned increasing orders due to rising demand. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about ordering too much to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units to meet immediate backlog while monitoring upcoming demand closely.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand and share forecast data to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that there is a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. With my current inventory of 210 units and no backlog, I believe we can fulfill our expected demand together. However, we need to be cautious of over-ordering to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 to align with anticipated demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's consider coordinating our order quantities to prevent excess stock and ensure we all meet demand efficiently.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns which could impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to prevent excess backlog and inventory. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly alignment meeting to discuss demand forecasts and order quantities to better synchronize our operations.
- Distributor: I hear no previous communications, so I would like to share that our recent demand has shown significant fluctuations with orders of 61, 46, and 74 units. This suggests a trend of increasing demand that we need to address collectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to stabilize supply and reduce the risk of backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to mitigate our backlog while monitoring future demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the recent demand fluctuations, indicating a trend towards higher orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory strategies to avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to mitigate backlog while being responsive to demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to better synchronize our orders.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 103 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [61, 46, 74]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [95]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 67
          - Last round profit: -66.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (103 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed significant demand fluctuations in recent rounds, with the last three demands being 61, 46, and 74 units. This variability can lead to increased backlog, as I currently have 103 units in backlog. I believe better communication about future demand expectations can help us all manage our inventory more effectively. Therefore, I propose that we establish a regular update protocol for demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect and improve our overall supply chain efficiency.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly to align our inventory decisions more closely.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned increasing orders due to rising demand. This aligns with my recent observations of fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about ordering too much to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units to meet immediate backlog while monitoring upcoming demand closely.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand and share forecast data to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that there is a potential increase in demand based on recent trends. With my current inventory of 210 units and no backlog, I believe we can fulfill our expected demand together. However, we need to be cautious of over-ordering to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 to align with anticipated demand while keeping a buffer.
  Proposal: Let's consider coordinating our order quantities to prevent excess stock and ensure we all meet demand efficiently.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns which could impact our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to prevent excess backlog and inventory. Therefore, I will suggest we share our demand forecasts more regularly to optimize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly alignment meeting to discuss demand forecasts and order quantities to better synchronize our operations.
- Distributor: I hear no previous communications, so I would like to share that our recent demand has shown significant fluctuations with orders of 61, 46, and 74 units. This suggests a trend of increasing demand that we need to address collectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to stabilize supply and reduce the risk of backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to mitigate our backlog while monitoring future demand closely.
  Proposal: I propose we share our order forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned the recent demand fluctuations, indicating a trend towards higher orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our inventory strategies to avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to mitigate backlog while being responsive to demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to better synchronize our orders.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 234, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 25, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -508.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=25, confidence=0.8, rationale=With sufficient inventory and low backlog, I can meet expected demand while maintaining a safety buffer., risk_assessment=Demand may spike unexpectedly, risking stockouts if not carefully monitored., expected_demand_next_round=25, llm_inventory=242, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 6, 8], llm_incoming=[66], llm_last_order=50
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 242 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 6, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [66]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: -72.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating significantly, with orders of 46, 74, and 66 units. This inconsistency may lead to a bullwhip effect if we don't align our ordering strategies. I suggest we coordinate our order quantities to better match the demand trends and minimize backlog across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's consider sharing our future demand forecasts with each other to help plan our orders more effectively and reduce excess inventory throughout the chain.
- Factory: I have not received any updates from other agents yet. However, I want to highlight that our recent demand has been high, with backlogs continuing to rise. This suggests a potential trend in increased demand that we should all prepare for. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to avoid overreactions to demand spikes and minimize excess inventory throughout the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which could help us align our orders more effectively.
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand orders of 11, 6, and 8 units, indicating a potential fluctuation in consumer behavior. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to prevent stockouts and backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies more closely to ensure we can meet the expected demand without overcommitting resources. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain a buffer while being prepared for any spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our projected demand and inventory levels more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that other agents are concerned about demand fluctuations and inventory management. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a balance between supply and demand while keeping my backlog in check.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing demand forecasts regularly to align our ordering strategies and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have noted that demand has significantly fluctuated recently with the last three orders being 46, 74, and 66 units. This inconsistency may contribute to the backlog we are experiencing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to enhance our communication regarding demand forecasts to better align our orders. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to minimize excess inventory and backlog across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular exchange of demand forecasts to help each agent adjust their orders more effectively and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I see that there has been significant demand recently, with orders peaking at 76 units. This highlights a trend of increasing demand in the market. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to manage inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our production and ordering cycles.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our inventories and reduce the risk of stockouts and backlogs.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        Previous communication history:
        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 247 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [46, 74, 66]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 170
          - Last round profit: -174.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (247 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent demand has been fluctuating significantly, with orders of 46, 74, and 66 units. This inconsistency may lead to a bullwhip effect if we don't align our ordering strategies. I suggest we coordinate our order quantities to better match the demand trends and minimize backlog across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's consider sharing our future demand forecasts with each other to help plan our orders more effectively and reduce excess inventory throughout the chain.
- Factory: I have not received any updates from other agents yet. However, I want to highlight that our recent demand has been high, with backlogs continuing to rise. This suggests a potential trend in increased demand that we should all prepare for. I recommend that we coordinate our orders to avoid overreactions to demand spikes and minimize excess inventory throughout the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which could help us align our orders more effectively.
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand orders of 11, 6, and 8 units, indicating a potential fluctuation in consumer behavior. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to prevent stockouts and backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies more closely to ensure we can meet the expected demand without overcommitting resources. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain a buffer while being prepared for any spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our projected demand and inventory levels more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that other agents are concerned about demand fluctuations and inventory management. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a balance between supply and demand while keeping my backlog in check.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing demand forecasts regularly to align our ordering strategies and reduce excess inventory.
- Distributor: I have noted that demand has significantly fluctuated recently with the last three orders being 46, 74, and 66 units. This inconsistency may contribute to the backlog we are experiencing. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to enhance our communication regarding demand forecasts to better align our orders. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next rounds to minimize excess inventory and backlog across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular exchange of demand forecasts to help each agent adjust their orders more effectively and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I see that there has been significant demand recently, with orders peaking at 76 units. This highlights a trend of increasing demand in the market. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to manage inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our production and ordering cycles.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our inventories and reduce the risk of stockouts and backlogs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 302 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 8, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [76]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: -77.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand last round. This could indicate a trend we need to prepare for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to adjust our order quantities to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will place a slightly higher order this round to better align with anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to help align our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer has indicated fluctuating demand patterns, which could affect our overall planning. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about placing large orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order quantity this round to align with anticipated demand and reduce backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear that we are all navigating demand fluctuations. Given the recent orders of 6, 8, and 6 units, it seems there is a slight upward trend. Therefore, I suggest we align our ordering strategies to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure we have sufficient stock across the supply chain. My inventory currently sits at 302 units, which allows some flexibility in responding to demand. However, we must remain vigilant about potential spikes. My conclusion is that we should keep communication open regarding our respective inventories and order quantities. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain a buffer while ensuring I can meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels and expected demand to better align our orders and reduce excess stock.
- Wholesaler: I hear that maintaining consistent communication regarding demand trends is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that understanding the fluctuations in our demand patterns will help us coordinate better and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I've observed a recent increase in demand with spikes reaching up to 8 units, leading to my current backlog of 73 units. This suggests that we may need to adjust our order quantities to meet potential increases in demand more effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular check-in to discuss demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly, which could help us balance inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns, which impacts our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with anticipated demand to avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better match the expected demand and suggest that we all share our demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our demand forecasts to better align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand orders of 76, 64, and 95 units, indicating potential fluctuations that may affect our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about expected demand to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round, as my current backlog is significant at 223 units, and I need to manage this effectively while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that all agents share their demand forecasts regularly to enhance visibility and reduce variability in our orders.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 73 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 8, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [95]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 120
          - Last round profit: -118.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (73 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand last round. This could indicate a trend we need to prepare for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to adjust our order quantities to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will place a slightly higher order this round to better align with anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to help align our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer has indicated fluctuating demand patterns, which could affect our overall planning. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about placing large orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order quantity this round to align with anticipated demand and reduce backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear that we are all navigating demand fluctuations. Given the recent orders of 6, 8, and 6 units, it seems there is a slight upward trend. Therefore, I suggest we align our ordering strategies to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure we have sufficient stock across the supply chain. My inventory currently sits at 302 units, which allows some flexibility in responding to demand. However, we must remain vigilant about potential spikes. My conclusion is that we should keep communication open regarding our respective inventories and order quantities. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain a buffer while ensuring I can meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels and expected demand to better align our orders and reduce excess stock.
- Wholesaler: I hear that maintaining consistent communication regarding demand trends is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that understanding the fluctuations in our demand patterns will help us coordinate better and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I've observed a recent increase in demand with spikes reaching up to 8 units, leading to my current backlog of 73 units. This suggests that we may need to adjust our order quantities to meet potential increases in demand more effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular check-in to discuss demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly, which could help us balance inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns, which impacts our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with anticipated demand to avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better match the expected demand and suggest that we all share our demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our demand forecasts to better align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand orders of 76, 64, and 95 units, indicating potential fluctuations that may affect our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about expected demand to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round, as my current backlog is significant at 223 units, and I need to manage this effectively while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that all agents share their demand forecasts regularly to enhance visibility and reduce variability in our orders.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 223 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [76, 64, 95]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 202
          - Last round profit: 1010.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (223 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a significant increase in demand last round. This could indicate a trend we need to prepare for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to adjust our order quantities to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will place a slightly higher order this round to better align with anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more regularly to help align our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer has indicated fluctuating demand patterns, which could affect our overall planning. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about placing large orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order quantity this round to align with anticipated demand and reduce backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear that we are all navigating demand fluctuations. Given the recent orders of 6, 8, and 6 units, it seems there is a slight upward trend. Therefore, I suggest we align our ordering strategies to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure we have sufficient stock across the supply chain. My inventory currently sits at 302 units, which allows some flexibility in responding to demand. However, we must remain vigilant about potential spikes. My conclusion is that we should keep communication open regarding our respective inventories and order quantities. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to maintain a buffer while ensuring I can meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels and expected demand to better align our orders and reduce excess stock.
- Wholesaler: I hear that maintaining consistent communication regarding demand trends is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that understanding the fluctuations in our demand patterns will help us coordinate better and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I've observed a recent increase in demand with spikes reaching up to 8 units, leading to my current backlog of 73 units. This suggests that we may need to adjust our order quantities to meet potential increases in demand more effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular check-in to discuss demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly, which could help us balance inventory across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns, which impacts our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with anticipated demand to avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to better match the expected demand and suggest that we all share our demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our demand forecasts to better align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed recent demand orders of 76, 64, and 95 units, indicating potential fluctuations that may affect our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more about expected demand to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round, as my current backlog is significant at 223 units, and I need to manage this effectively while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose that all agents share their demand forecasts regularly to enhance visibility and reduce variability in our orders.

--------------------- Round 8 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [66, 64, 98, 202]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that effective communication is key to managing our supply chain efficiently. As the Retailer, I've observed a recent demand trend with orders averaging around 8-10 units. This indicates a stable demand, but I also recognize the risk of fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our order quantities to better align with actual demand patterns. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units for the next round to ensure I can meet both expected demand and any potential spikes.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining a buffer stock while anticipating demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose that we share our order forecasts and inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 352 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to respond to demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a stable demand trend with orders averaging around 8-10 units and are maintaining their order quantity at 50 units. This indicates a careful approach to manage potential demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the Retailer's strategy is reasonable, my current backlog of 119 units signifies that I need to address immediate demand effectively. Therefore, I will place a smaller order of 20 units in the next round to gradually replenish my inventory while also considering the Retailer's stable demand insight.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on gradual replenishment while addressing backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our order forecasts and inventory levels to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 119 units, indicating a pressing need to fulfill outstanding orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they observed a stable demand trend with orders averaging around 8-10 units and are maintaining their order quantity at 50 units. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 119 units and their plan to place a smaller order of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a need for better alignment in our order strategies to manage the backlog and avoid stockouts effectively. Therefore, I will place a smaller order of 20 units next round to help alleviate my current backlog of 634 units and align with the Retailer's stable demand insight.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on gradual replenishment to manage backlog while anticipating demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities more closely based on our collective demand insights to minimize fluctuations and the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 634 units and no inventory, indicating a critical need to fulfill outstanding orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain an order quantity at 50 units to meet expected demand and potential spikes. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 119 units and their plan to place a smaller order of 20 units to gradually replenish inventory. Additionally, the Distributor mentioned their significant backlog of 634 units and their plan to align with the Retailer's strategy by also ordering 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that immediate collaboration is essential to address our current backlogs and align our strategies effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units next round to help fulfill backlog demands while also considering the insights shared by others.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on coordinated ordering to manage backlogs and avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and forecasts more frequently to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 93 units and no inventory, indicating my need to fulfill outstanding orders promptly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned their backlog of 119 units and their plan to place a smaller order of 20 units to gradually replenish inventory. I also hear the Distributor stating their backlog of 634 units and their intent to align with my strategy by ordering 20 units. Additionally, the Factory indicated their need to fulfill a backlog of 93 units while also ordering 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all face backlogs, our individual order quantities remain conservative, which may not sufficiently address the overall demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units for the next round to ensure I can meet my expected demand while also providing a buffer for fluctuations in demand from all agents.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain a proactive ordering strategy while being mindful of the collective backlogs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities and adjust our forecasts based on shared demand insights to more effectively manage our backlogs and stock levels.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 352 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to respond to demand while supporting others in the supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 50 units to ensure they can meet expected demand and provide a buffer for fluctuations. I also acknowledge the Distributor's plan to order 20 units to help alleviate their backlog of 634 units, and the Factory's similar approach. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all face significant backlogs, our individual order strategies are still conservative and may not sufficiently address the overall demand in the supply chain. Therefore, I will increase my order to 40 units in the next round to better align with the anticipated demand and help mitigate my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: Adjust order quantities to better meet collective demand while managing backlogs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our order forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us minimize the bullwhip effect and align our ordering strategies.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 119 units, indicating an urgent need to fulfill outstanding orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 50 units to meet expected demand and provide a buffer for fluctuations. I also acknowledge the Wholesaler's decision to increase their order to 40 units to better align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all experiencing backlogs, it is essential to ensure that our collective orders adequately address overall demand. Therefore, I will increase my order to 40 units this round to help mitigate my backlog and align with the increased orders from others.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on adjusting order quantities to better meet collective demand while managing backlogs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on shared demand insights to effectively manage our backlogs and stock levels.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 634 units and no inventory, indicating my critical need to fulfill outstanding orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 50 units to ensure they can meet expected demand and provide a buffer for fluctuations. I also acknowledge the Wholesaler's decision to increase their order to 40 units to better align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while our individual strategies are evolving, we need to ensure that our collective orders are sufficient to address the significant backlogs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units next round to help fulfill outstanding orders while balancing inventory needs.
  Strategy Hint: Align order quantities to effectively address collective backlogs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our order forecasts more frequently to better coordinate our inventory and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have a backlog of 93 units and no inventory, indicating my pressing need to fulfill outstanding orders promptly.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have noted recent demand fluctuations with orders of 66, 76, and 64 units. This indicates a potential upward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider adjusting our orders to better align with these demand levels. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to manage my backlog effectively while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our order forecasts with each other to better coordinate our supply efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a spike in recent demand, which could indicate a trend we need to consider. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order this round to align with the expected demand and prevent backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 8, 6, and 10 units. This pattern suggests that we might need to stay agile in our inventory management. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to balance supply across the chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to prepare for the expected demand next round while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our inventory levels and expected demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in demand, which aligns with my own observations of recent orders averaging around 8-10 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to stay agile to meet varying demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to maintain a buffer and avoid further backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 634 units and no inventory. I've observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 66, 76, and 64 units. It's crucial for us to share our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect. I suggest we align our order quantities based on our collective demand insights to ensure smoother operations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our collective decision-making.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly with orders of 64, 95, and 98 units. This inconsistency may contribute to inefficiencies in our supply chain. Therefore, I suggest we enhance communication regarding demand forecasts to better align our production and inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update mechanism for demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve order accuracy across our supply chain.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 119 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 6, 10]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 100
          - Last round profit: -123.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (119 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have noted recent demand fluctuations with orders of 66, 76, and 64 units. This indicates a potential upward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider adjusting our orders to better align with these demand levels. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to manage my backlog effectively while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our order forecasts with each other to better coordinate our supply efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a spike in recent demand, which could indicate a trend we need to consider. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order this round to align with the expected demand and prevent backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 8, 6, and 10 units. This pattern suggests that we might need to stay agile in our inventory management. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to balance supply across the chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to prepare for the expected demand next round while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our inventory levels and expected demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in demand, which aligns with my own observations of recent orders averaging around 8-10 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to stay agile to meet varying demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to maintain a buffer and avoid further backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 634 units and no inventory. I've observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 66, 76, and 64 units. It's crucial for us to share our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect. I suggest we align our order quantities based on our collective demand insights to ensure smoother operations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our collective decision-making.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly with orders of 64, 95, and 98 units. This inconsistency may contribute to inefficiencies in our supply chain. Therefore, I suggest we enhance communication regarding demand forecasts to better align our production and inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update mechanism for demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve order accuracy across our supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 93 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [64, 95, 98]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 303
          - Last round profit: 1223.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (93 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have noted recent demand fluctuations with orders of 66, 76, and 64 units. This indicates a potential upward trend in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should consider adjusting our orders to better align with these demand levels. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units this round to manage my backlog effectively while anticipating future demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our order forecasts with each other to better coordinate our supply efforts and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a spike in recent demand, which could indicate a trend we need to consider. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order this round to align with the expected demand and prevent backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 8, 6, and 10 units. This pattern suggests that we might need to stay agile in our inventory management. I hear that maintaining adequate inventory is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to balance supply across the chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to prepare for the expected demand next round while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our inventory levels and expected demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in demand, which aligns with my own observations of recent orders averaging around 8-10 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to stay agile to meet varying demand. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to maintain a buffer and avoid further backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 634 units and no inventory. I've observed recent demand fluctuating with orders of 66, 76, and 64 units. It's crucial for us to share our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect. I suggest we align our order quantities based on our collective demand insights to ensure smoother operations.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our collective decision-making.
- Factory: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly with orders of 64, 95, and 98 units. This inconsistency may contribute to inefficiencies in our supply chain. Therefore, I suggest we enhance communication regarding demand forecasts to better align our production and inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular update mechanism for demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve order accuracy across our supply chain.

          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [95]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: -121.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent orders have fluctuated significantly with demands of 76, 64, and 95 units. This indicates potential volatility in our demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our ordering strategies to better align with actual demand and reduce backlog. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to manage my inventory while anticipating continued variability in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect in the supply chain.
- Factory: I observe that recent demand has fluctuated significantly with orders of 95, 98, and 122 units. This pattern suggests a potential increase in demand variability. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate more consistently to align our orders with actual demand. Therefore, I will suggest we share our current inventory levels and projected demand more frequently to help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a weekly communication schedule to share our inventory and demand forecasts, enabling us to better align our orders.
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Therefore, I want to share my current inventory situation and expected demand. My inventory stands at 414 units with no backlog, and I anticipate a demand of around 50 units next round. This should help in planning your orders appropriately to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demands for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer has indicated an increase in demand patterns due to seasonal changes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may face a significant backlog if we do not coordinate our orders effectively. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to help mitigate the backlog and ensure a smoother flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a consistent communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 885 units and zero inventory. Recent demand has shown fluctuations with orders of 76, 64, and 95 units. I suggest we coordinate on demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect. Collaboration in sharing insights on expected demand can help all of us manage our inventory levels more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly demand forecast that we can all share to align our ordering strategies.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are concerned about the increasing backlog and fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order of 20 units this round, while suggesting that we all share our demand forecasts more openly to align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce variability.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          - Incoming shipments this round: [303]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 700
          - Last round profit: -773.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (885 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that recent orders have fluctuated significantly with demands of 76, 64, and 95 units. This indicates potential volatility in our demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our ordering strategies to better align with actual demand and reduce backlog. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to manage my inventory while anticipating continued variability in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect in the supply chain.
- Factory: I observe that recent demand has fluctuated significantly with orders of 95, 98, and 122 units. This pattern suggests a potential increase in demand variability. I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate more consistently to align our orders with actual demand. Therefore, I will suggest we share our current inventory levels and projected demand more frequently to help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a weekly communication schedule to share our inventory and demand forecasts, enabling us to better align our orders.
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Therefore, I want to share my current inventory situation and expected demand. My inventory stands at 414 units with no backlog, and I anticipate a demand of around 50 units next round. This should help in planning your orders appropriately to avoid stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demands for the next rounds to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer has indicated an increase in demand patterns due to seasonal changes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may face a significant backlog if we do not coordinate our orders effectively. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to help mitigate the backlog and ensure a smoother flow in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a consistent communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 885 units and zero inventory. Recent demand has shown fluctuations with orders of 76, 64, and 95 units. I suggest we coordinate on demand forecasts to reduce the bullwhip effect. Collaboration in sharing insights on expected demand can help all of us manage our inventory levels more effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly demand forecast that we can all share to align our ordering strategies.
- Factory: I hear that other agents are concerned about the increasing backlog and fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and reduce the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain a conservative order of 20 units this round, while suggesting that we all share our demand forecasts more openly to align our strategies.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce variability.

--------------------- Round 10 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [64, 98, 255, 180]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear there may be fluctuations in demand as indicated by recent orders. To optimize our supply chain, we should consider sharing more accurate demand forecasts. I’ve observed an average demand of 8.33 units over the last three rounds, but my expected demand next round is 50 units, which is significantly higher. Based on this, my conclusion is we may face a backlog if we don’t align our ordering strategies. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 to prepare for potential spikes.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to minimize stockouts and backlogs across the chain.
  Information Shared: I currently hold 463 units in inventory with no backlog, and I am placing an order of 50 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that their expected demand next round is 50 units, significantly higher than their recent average of 8.33 units. This suggests we may indeed face a backlog if we don't align our ordering strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate better to ensure we can meet this projected demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to start replenishing my inventory while keeping an eye on trends in demand from other agents.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory management with a proactive response to anticipated demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more frequently to align our orders and minimize the risk of backlogs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 101 units, with my last order being 108 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said their expected demand next round is 50 units, which is significantly higher than their recent average of 8.33 units. Additionally, the Wholesaler echoed the need for better coordination to meet this projected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid creating a backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to start addressing my backlog while being mindful of the Retailer's anticipated demand increase.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to balance my inventory management while responding to anticipated demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we all share our demand forecasts more frequently to align our orders and minimize the risk of backlogs across the supply chain.

  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to better align our strategies and minimize stockouts.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 2613 units, with my last order being 107 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both emphasized the need for better coordination in response to the expected demand increase. This shared concern about potential backlogs aligns with my own observations regarding the significant gap between recent demand and expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our order quantities more effectively to mitigate the risk of backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to prepare for the anticipated demand while encouraging all of us to keep a close watch on inventory levels and demand forecasts.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning our orders based on shared demand insights will help reduce backlogs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular cadence for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our ordering strategies across the supply chain.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 463 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [98]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: -185.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: As the Distributor, I observe that recent demand has fluctuated significantly with orders of 64, 95, and 98 units. I hear the Retailer might be experiencing similar variations in demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our order quantities to better align with actual demand and minimize backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to ensure we all have a clearer understanding of future needs.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a regular communication channel for sharing weekly demand forecasts and order quantities to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that demand is fluctuating significantly based on recent orders, with the latest being quite high. This suggests a potential spike in demand that we need to prepare for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to ensure we can meet these spikes without creating excess backlog. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units to manage my backlog while not overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our inventories and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to share my current situation. My recent demand has been fluctuating, with small orders that could indicate a trend towards lower demand. I suggest that we closely monitor our inventory levels to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Collaboration could help us better align our orders to meet demand without over-ordering and causing excess inventory. I will place an order of 50 units based on my expected demand for the next round.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to match observed demand patterns and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that demand fluctuations are a concern for everyone in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our orders to stabilize inventory levels and reduce backlog. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to help meet the expected demand and stabilize my backlog situation.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our inventory decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned increasing demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my observations of recent orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels to prevent excessive backlog. Therefore, I will proceed with a conservative order to manage my backlog while preparing for potential future demand spikes.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts with each other regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear there is a significant backlog in demand, and it seems we all face challenges in meeting the current orders. Given that my current inventory is zero and I have a backlog of 2613 units, it highlights the urgency for us to communicate more frequently about our capacities and upcoming demand patterns. My conclusion is that we need to improve our information sharing to better align our orders and reduce excess backlog. Therefore, I will propose regular updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts among us to optimize our production and distribution.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to share our inventory status and demand forecasts to help us coordinate better.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 944 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [64, 95, 98]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 900
          - Last round profit: -993.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (944 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: As the Distributor, I observe that recent demand has fluctuated significantly with orders of 64, 95, and 98 units. I hear the Retailer might be experiencing similar variations in demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our order quantities to better align with actual demand and minimize backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts more openly to ensure we all have a clearer understanding of future needs.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a regular communication channel for sharing weekly demand forecasts and order quantities to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear that demand is fluctuating significantly based on recent orders, with the latest being quite high. This suggests a potential spike in demand that we need to prepare for. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our order quantities to ensure we can meet these spikes without creating excess backlog. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units to manage my backlog while not overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our inventories and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to share my current situation. My recent demand has been fluctuating, with small orders that could indicate a trend towards lower demand. I suggest that we closely monitor our inventory levels to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Collaboration could help us better align our orders to meet demand without over-ordering and causing excess inventory. I will place an order of 50 units based on my expected demand for the next round.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to match observed demand patterns and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that demand fluctuations are a concern for everyone in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to better align our orders to stabilize inventory levels and reduce backlog. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 20 units to help meet the expected demand and stabilize my backlog situation.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our inventory decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned increasing demand due to seasonal trends. This aligns with my observations of recent orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory levels to prevent excessive backlog. Therefore, I will proceed with a conservative order to manage my backlog while preparing for potential future demand spikes.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts with each other regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear there is a significant backlog in demand, and it seems we all face challenges in meeting the current orders. Given that my current inventory is zero and I have a backlog of 2613 units, it highlights the urgency for us to communicate more frequently about our capacities and upcoming demand patterns. My conclusion is that we need to improve our information sharing to better align our orders and reduce excess backlog. Therefore, I will propose regular updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts among us to optimize our production and distribution.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly check-in to share our inventory status and demand forecasts to help us coordinate better.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Communication Output: {"message": "I hear there is a significant backlog in demand, and it seems we all face challenges in meeting the current orders. Given that my current inventory is zero and I have a backlog of 2613 units, it highlights the urgency for us to communicate more frequently about our capacities and upcoming demand patterns. My conclusion is that we need to improve our information sharing to better align our orders and reduce excess backlog. Therefore, I will propose regular updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts among us to optimize our production and distribution.", "strategy_hint": "I plan to order 20 units to gradually reduce backlog while monitoring demand closely.", "collaboration_proposal": "Let's establish a weekly check-in to share our inventory status and demand forecasts to help us coordinate better.", "information_shared": "I currently have a backlog of 2613 units and no inventory, indicating a critical need for collaborative efforts to meet demand.", "confidence": 0.8}

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 100,
          "backlog": 0,
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,
          "rationale": "<brief explanation of your reasoning>",
          "risk_assessment": "<describe any risks you anticipate>",
          "expected_demand_next_round": <integer>,
          "order_quantity": <integer>
        }

        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no markdown, no triple backticks, no code fences, and do NOT write the word 'json' anywhere. Your reply must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else. If you include anything else, your answer will be rejected. KEEP IT RATHER SHORT
