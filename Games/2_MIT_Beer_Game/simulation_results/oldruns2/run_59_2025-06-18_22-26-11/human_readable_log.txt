--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be prepared for higher order quantities in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 20 units to align with this anticipated demand, while still maintaining my inventory buffer.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to keep a balance between sufficient inventory and minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to prevent stockouts across the supply chain and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, my inventory is at 99 units with no backlog, and I expect a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned adjusting their order to 20 units based on anticipated demand. This aligns with my observation of increasing demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for higher order quantities to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 60 units to maintain my inventory buffer and meet the expected demands.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 99, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=Maintain inventory buffer to meet anticipated demand while avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Increased demand could lead to understocking; careful order planning is essential., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=99, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

This indicates a strong anticipation of increased demand across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain aligned on our order quantities to ensure we can meet this expected demand efficiently while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will proceed with my planned order of 20 units to maintain my inventory buffer and respond to the anticipated demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share our inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we are all prepared for the expected demand.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 20 units to respond to anticipated demand, while the Distributor and Factory are also aligning their orders based on the same demand expectations. This indicates a strong consensus on the need to prepare for increased demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain vigilant in our planning to avoid stockouts and manage inventory effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 60 units to ensure I have enough inventory to meet the expected demand and support the supply chain's stability.
  Proposal: Let's continue to share our inventory levels and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 20 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order of 60 units to ensure adequate inventory. This indicates a strong consensus on anticipating increased demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to remain aligned to effectively manage our inventory levels and prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to keep up with the expected demand while ensuring I have sufficient stock on hand.
  Proposal: Let's continue to share our inventory levels and order quantities regularly to ensure we are all prepared for the expected demand and to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 20 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order of 60 units. The Distributor also noted they will keep their order of 20 units to align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a strong consensus on the anticipated demand of 20 units, but the Wholesaler's larger order may lead to excess inventory in the supply chain. Therefore, I will proceed with my order of 20 units to align with the anticipated demand while managing my inventory efficiently.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will place a conservative order to maintain stock while anticipating future demand.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to 20 units based on anticipated demand, and the Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 60 units to maintain their inventory buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all anticipating increased demand and should align our orders to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will also place an order of 20 units to ensure I have sufficient stock while considering the trends shared by both the Retailer and Wholesaler.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to align with expected demand and minimize the bullwhip effect throughout the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to 20 units based on anticipated demand, and the Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 60 units to maintain their inventory buffer. The Distributor also noted they will place an order of 20 units to align with the anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all anticipating increased demand, and coordination is key to prevent stockouts while managing inventory levels effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover the expected demand while maintaining a balance in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's keep communication open about our orders in the upcoming rounds to ensure we are all aligned and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned placing an order of 60 units and the Distributor said they will order 20 units. This indicates a strong anticipation of increased demand across the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain aligned on our order quantities to ensure we can meet this expected demand efficiently while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will proceed with my planned order of 20 units to maintain my inventory buffer and respond to the anticipated demand without overcommitting resources.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders and share our inventory levels regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we are all prepared for the expected demand.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned maintaining their order of 20 units to respond to anticipated demand, while the Distributor and Factory are also aligning their orders based on the same demand expectations. This indicates a strong consensus on the need to prepare for increased demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain vigilant in our planning to avoid stockouts and manage inventory effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 60 units to ensure I have enough inventory to meet the expected demand and support the supply chain's stability.
  Proposal: Let's continue to share our inventory levels and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 20 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order of 60 units to ensure adequate inventory. This indicates a strong consensus on anticipating increased demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to remain aligned to effectively manage our inventory levels and prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to keep up with the expected demand while ensuring I have sufficient stock on hand.
  Proposal: Let's continue to share our inventory levels and order quantities regularly to ensure we are all prepared for the expected demand and to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will proceed with their planned order of 20 units, and the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order of 60 units. The Distributor also noted they will keep their order of 20 units to align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that there is a strong consensus on the anticipated demand of 20 units, but the Wholesaler's larger order may lead to excess inventory in the supply chain. Therefore, I will proceed with my order of 20 units to align with the anticipated demand while managing my inventory efficiently.
  Proposal: Let's share our inventory levels regularly to ensure we can effectively coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 2 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial to meet demand without incurring high holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order quantities to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to align with expected demand and maintain sufficient inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on balancing orders with expected demand to minimize stockouts.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 98, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 22, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 11.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=22, confidence=0.75, rationale=To meet anticipated demand while avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Increased demand may lead to stockouts if not managed properly., expected_demand_next_round=22, llm_inventory=98, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 11], llm_incoming=[31], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 58 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 31]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [71]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will place a conservative order to maintain stock while anticipating future demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our order quantities to prevent stockouts, and Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our ordering strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining an optimal balance between inventory levels and anticipated demand is crucial for all of us. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to sustain our stock and meet the expected demand while avoiding overstock.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which can help us align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our order quantities to prevent stockouts and Wholesaler emphasized the need to align ordering strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must collaborate to balance our orders effectively. I noticed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase in orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain a steady supply while avoiding overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our updated inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to enhance our synchronization and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler said we need to align our ordering strategies to optimize inventory levels, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced inventory while anticipating future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should continue sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to enhance our synchronization. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units this round to align with expected demand while keeping my inventory levels sufficient.
  Proposal: I propose we all agree on a schedule to regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we should continue sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to enhance synchronization. I also heard Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining balanced inventory while anticipating future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all have a shared interest in optimizing our inventory levels to avoid stockouts and overstock. Therefore, I will place an order of 60 units this round, as my current inventory is sufficient, and I anticipate a higher demand next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should continue sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to enhance synchronization, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our ordering strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate closely to avoid stockouts and manage our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units this round to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while balancing my inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will help us align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Wholesaler said we need to align our ordering strategies and that they will place an order of 60 units this round. Additionally, Distributor emphasized maintaining balanced inventory levels while anticipating demand, deciding to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aware of the need to coordinate our orders to optimize inventory levels. However, I have observed significant fluctuations in demand, with a recent spike in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 20 units this round to avoid overstocking while still ensuring a steady supply.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform to regularly update our demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to align our ordering strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 38 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 51]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our order quantities to prevent stockouts, and Wholesaler emphasized the need to align our ordering strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining an optimal balance between inventory levels and anticipated demand is crucial for all of us. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 20 units this round to sustain our stock and meet the expected demand while avoiding overstock.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which can help us align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our order quantities to prevent stockouts and Wholesaler emphasized the need to align ordering strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must collaborate to balance our orders effectively. I noticed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a sharp increase in orders. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units this round to maintain a steady supply while avoiding overstocking.
  Proposal: I propose we all share our updated inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to enhance our synchronization and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear Wholesaler said we need to align our ordering strategies to optimize inventory levels, and Distributor emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced inventory while anticipating future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should continue sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to enhance our synchronization. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units this round to align with expected demand while keeping my inventory levels sufficient.
  Proposal: I propose we all agree on a schedule to regularly share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we should continue sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to enhance synchronization. I also heard Distributor emphasize the importance of maintaining balanced inventory while anticipating future demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all have a shared interest in optimizing our inventory levels to avoid stockouts and overstock. Therefore, I will place an order of 60 units this round, as my current inventory is sufficient, and I anticipate a higher demand next round.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should continue sharing our demand forecasts and order quantities to enhance synchronization, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our ordering strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to coordinate closely to avoid stockouts and manage our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units this round to ensure I can meet the anticipated demand while balancing my inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will help us align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Wholesaler said we need to align our ordering strategies and that they will place an order of 60 units this round. Additionally, Distributor emphasized maintaining balanced inventory levels while anticipating demand, deciding to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aware of the need to coordinate our orders to optimize inventory levels. However, I have observed significant fluctuations in demand, with a recent spike in orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 20 units this round to avoid overstocking while still ensuring a steady supply.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform to regularly update our demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to align our ordering strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [11, 11, 11, 20]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering or understocking. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory at 99 units while anticipating a demand of 20 units next round, and I suggest we all share our expected demands to align our orders.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining sufficient inventory while being responsive to demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to update each other on demand forecasts and inventory levels to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Current inventory at 99 units and an expected demand of 20 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering or understocking. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expectations to optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory while anticipating a demand of 60 units for the next round, which may be higher than expected. I suggest we coordinate our orders to ensure we all meet the anticipated demand without creating excess backlog.
  Strategy Hint: Align inventory levels and order quantities to match anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for real-time updates on inventory and demand forecasts to mitigate the bullwhip effect.

  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering or understocking. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to carefully assess our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to avoid potential backlog issues. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 17 units and place a conservative order of 20 units for the next round to ensure we can meet any unexpected increases in demand while minimizing excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on balancing inventory levels and anticipating demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we create a shared document to track our current inventory levels and expected demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.

I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels across the supply chain. Additionally, the Distributor emphasized the importance of carefully assessing inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to better meet the anticipated demand while minimizing excess backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units for the next round to cover the expected demand, but I encourage everyone to communicate their actual demand more frequently to avoid stockouts or overstock situations.
  Strategy Hint: Align order quantities with expected demand to reduce backlog risks.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared communication platform for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units, which indicates urgency in fulfilling orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels, and the Distributor emphasized the importance of carefully assessing inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 99 units and place an order of 20 units for the next round, aligning with the expected demand while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining inventory levels while collaborating on demand forecasts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform to regularly update each other on inventory levels and demand forecasts, reducing the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and anticipate an order quantity of 20 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to ensure our orders are well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts, and the Distributor emphasized careful assessment of inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should work together to align our orders closely with anticipated demand to optimize our supply chain efficiency. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 57 units and place an order of 60 units for the next round to meet the expected demand while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we utilize a shared platform for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to enhance coordination.
  Information Shared: I currently have 57 units in inventory and anticipate an order quantity of 60 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should maintain our orders well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our expected demand more transparently to optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units for the next round, as I expect demand to stabilize around that figure, while ensuring we are prepared for any fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on transparency in demand expectations to optimize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we create a shared dashboard for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 17 units in inventory and will be placing an order of 20 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels, and the Distributor emphasized careful assessment of inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and backlog, especially given my current backlog of 14 units. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units for the next round to help fulfill our collective demands while encouraging all to communicate their actual demand more frequently.
  Strategy Hint: Prioritize coordination in order quantities to balance supply and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we set up a regular update system to share inventory levels and demand forecasts effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units, highlighting the urgency in fulfilling orders.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 99, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: 12.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=Maintain adequate inventory to meet demand while minimizing holding costs., risk_assessment=Increased demand could lead to stockouts; need to order cautiously., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=99, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 11, 10], llm_incoming=[32], llm_last_order=22
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 22
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering or understocking. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to carefully assess our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to avoid potential backlog issues. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 17 units and place a conservative order of 20 units for the next round to ensure we can meet any unexpected increases in demand while minimizing excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we create a shared document to track our current inventory levels and expected demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor demand fluctuations and maintain optimal inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels across the supply chain. Additionally, the Distributor emphasized the importance of carefully assessing inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to better meet the anticipated demand while minimizing excess backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units for the next round to cover the expected demand, but I encourage everyone to communicate their actual demand more frequently to avoid stockouts or overstock situations.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 17 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 31, 32]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [58]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will place a conservative order to maintain stock while anticipating future demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering or understocking. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to carefully assess our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to avoid potential backlog issues. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 17 units and place a conservative order of 20 units for the next round to ensure we can meet any unexpected increases in demand while minimizing excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we create a shared document to track our current inventory levels and expected demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor demand fluctuations and maintain optimal inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels across the supply chain. Additionally, the Distributor emphasized the importance of carefully assessing inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to better meet the anticipated demand while minimizing excess backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units for the next round to cover the expected demand, but I encourage everyone to communicate their actual demand more frequently to avoid stockouts or overstock situations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared communication platform for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels, and the Distributor emphasized the importance of carefully assessing inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 99 units and place an order of 20 units for the next round, aligning with the expected demand while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform to regularly update each other on inventory levels and demand forecasts, reducing the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to ensure our orders are well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts, and the Distributor emphasized careful assessment of inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should work together to align our orders closely with anticipated demand to optimize our supply chain efficiency. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 57 units and place an order of 60 units for the next round to meet the expected demand while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we utilize a shared platform for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to enhance coordination.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should maintain our orders well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our expected demand more transparently to optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units for the next round, as I expect demand to stabilize around that figure, while ensuring we are prepared for any fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we create a shared dashboard for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels, and the Distributor emphasized careful assessment of inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and backlog, especially given my current backlog of 14 units. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units for the next round to help fulfill our collective demands while encouraging all to communicate their actual demand more frequently.
  Proposal: I propose we set up a regular update system to share inventory levels and demand forecasts effectively.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 14 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 51, 52]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to cover expected demand while avoiding stockouts.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor demand fluctuations to avoid over-ordering or understocking. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to carefully assess our current inventory levels and anticipated demand to avoid potential backlog issues. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 17 units and place a conservative order of 20 units for the next round to ensure we can meet any unexpected increases in demand while minimizing excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we create a shared document to track our current inventory levels and expected demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor demand fluctuations and maintain optimal inventory levels. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels across the supply chain. Additionally, the Distributor emphasized the importance of carefully assessing inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to better meet the anticipated demand while minimizing excess backlog. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units for the next round to cover the expected demand, but I encourage everyone to communicate their actual demand more frequently to avoid stockouts or overstock situations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared communication platform for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels, and the Distributor emphasized the importance of carefully assessing inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 99 units and place an order of 20 units for the next round, aligning with the expected demand while keeping an eye on potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform to regularly update each other on inventory levels and demand forecasts, reducing the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to ensure our orders are well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts, and the Distributor emphasized careful assessment of inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should work together to align our orders closely with anticipated demand to optimize our supply chain efficiency. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory of 57 units and place an order of 60 units for the next round to meet the expected demand while keeping a buffer for fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we utilize a shared platform for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to enhance coordination.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should maintain our orders well-coordinated to prevent overstocking or stockouts. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders closely with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our expected demand more transparently to optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units for the next round, as I expect demand to stabilize around that figure, while ensuring we are prepared for any fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we create a shared dashboard for real-time updates on our inventory and demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our expectations to optimize inventory levels, and the Distributor emphasized careful assessment of inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and backlog, especially given my current backlog of 14 units. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units for the next round to help fulfill our collective demands while encouraging all to communicate their actual demand more frequently.
  Proposal: I propose we set up a regular update system to share inventory levels and demand forecasts effectively.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.
