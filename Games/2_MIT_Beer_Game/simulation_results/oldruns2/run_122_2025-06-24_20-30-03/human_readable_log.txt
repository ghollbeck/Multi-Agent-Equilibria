--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand and current inventory levels to optimize our ordering strategy and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 40 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $5.00 so far.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 40 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing that my profit of $5.00 is at risk if we do not manage our orders effectively. We must avoid stockouts and oversupply to maintain profitability for all.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we all share our expected demand and current inventory levels to optimize our ordering strategy and prevent any potential stock-outs or oversupply.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to ensure we all order appropriately and maintain a steady flow of products.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory across the supply chain. Therefore, I will share my current inventory of 40 units and a backlog of 0 units, emphasizing that my profit of $5.00 is at risk if we do not manage our orders effectively. We must avoid stockouts and oversupply to maintain profitability for all.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 40 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

External demand (Retailer): 4
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 36 units in inventory and no backlog, but my profit is at -$3.00. I aim to avoid stock-outs while minimizing holding costs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expectations and orders to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $57.00. I propose we regularly communicate our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while fulfilling orders to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders effectively.
  Information Shared: I have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, and my current profit is $57.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. I also note that the Wholesaler proposed regular communication to align our expectations and orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work closely together to avoid stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between fulfilling orders and managing my backlog to prevent excessive costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders effectively and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units, with a total profit of $99.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's proposals for regular communication to align our expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work closely together to avoid stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. This situation threatens my profit of $90.00 and could lead to increased backlog costs for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while preventing the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on balancing production to meet demand while minimizing backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders effectively and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which impacts my profit and could affect the entire supply chain.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 36 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate effectively to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our expectations and orders to avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $57.00. I propose we regularly communicate our expected demand and inventory levels to optimize our orders and prevent stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders effectively.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. I also note that the Wholesaler proposed regular communication to align our expectations and orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work closely together to avoid stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 4 units. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders effectively and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer emphasized the importance of coordinating our orders to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor's proposals for regular communication to align our expectations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to work closely together to avoid stock-outs, especially since I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units. This situation threatens my profit of $90.00 and could lead to increased backlog costs for all of us. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand and inventory levels more frequently to optimize our orders and ensure we all remain profitable while preventing the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a routine for sharing our expected demand and inventory levels to align our orders effectively and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($90.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (10 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 30]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $7.00, and I have 35 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a stable flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping a buffer to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 35 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet immediate demand but requires careful planning for future orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should all consider our order quantities carefully to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while considering my current backlog and inventory situation.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler mentioned their risk of stockouts due to a backlog of 5 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to ensure a stable flow of products and avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand for the next round and coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $64.00, but with a backlog of 40 units and no inventory, I am at risk of increased backlog costs if we do not manage our orders carefully. Let's work together to optimize our order quantities and maintain supply chain stability.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the collective expected demand while managing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 40 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to increased costs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler mentioned their risk of stockouts due to a backlog of 5 units, and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand to avoid excessive backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about our production and order quantities to maintain a stable flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stockouts and oversupply, as my current inventory is at 0 units and I have a backlog of 18 units. This situation puts me at risk of increased backlog costs, which could affect my profit trajectory of $138.00. Let's work together to optimize our order quantities and ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding a potential market collapse.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on our collective expected demand while managing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stockouts and oversupply.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 35 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [26]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 4, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $7.00, and I have 35 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a stable flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should all consider our order quantities carefully to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler mentioned their risk of stockouts due to a backlog of 5 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to ensure a stable flow of products and avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand for the next round and coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $64.00, but with a backlog of 40 units and no inventory, I am at risk of increased backlog costs if we do not manage our orders carefully. Let's work together to optimize our order quantities and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler mentioned their risk of stockouts due to a backlog of 5 units, and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand to avoid excessive backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about our production and order quantities to maintain a stable flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stockouts and oversupply, as my current inventory is at 0 units and I have a backlog of 18 units. This situation puts me at risk of increased backlog costs, which could affect my profit trajectory of $138.00. Let's work together to optimize our order quantities and ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding a potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stockouts and oversupply.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 40 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 24, 26]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 28
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (40 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $7.00, and I have 35 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a stable flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should all consider our order quantities carefully to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler mentioned their risk of stockouts due to a backlog of 5 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to ensure a stable flow of products and avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand for the next round and coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $64.00, but with a backlog of 40 units and no inventory, I am at risk of increased backlog costs if we do not manage our orders carefully. Let's work together to optimize our order quantities and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler mentioned their risk of stockouts due to a backlog of 5 units, and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand to avoid excessive backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about our production and order quantities to maintain a stable flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stockouts and oversupply, as my current inventory is at 0 units and I have a backlog of 18 units. This situation puts me at risk of increased backlog costs, which could affect my profit trajectory of $138.00. Let's work together to optimize our order quantities and ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding a potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stockouts and oversupply.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $7.00, and I have 35 units in inventory with no backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will suggest that we all share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders and maintain a stable flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our expected demand to maintain a stable flow of products. Therefore, I will share that I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. To maximize our collective profits, we should all consider our order quantities carefully to avoid the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without excess inventory. I suggest we all share our expected demand for the next round to optimize our orders and prevent any disruptions in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, and Wholesaler mentioned their risk of stockouts due to a backlog of 5 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to align our expected demand to ensure a stable flow of products and avoid excessive backlog. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing our expected demand for the next round and coordinating our orders to prevent the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $64.00, but with a backlog of 40 units and no inventory, I am at risk of increased backlog costs if we do not manage our orders carefully. Let's work together to optimize our order quantities and maintain supply chain stability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our orders to prevent stockouts and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Wholesaler mentioned their risk of stockouts due to a backlog of 5 units, and Distributor emphasized the importance of aligning our expected demand to avoid excessive backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about our production and order quantities to maintain a stable flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stockouts and oversupply, as my current inventory is at 0 units and I have a backlog of 18 units. This situation puts me at risk of increased backlog costs, which could affect my profit trajectory of $138.00. Let's work together to optimize our order quantities and ensure we all remain profitable while avoiding a potential market collapse.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our expected demand for the next round and coordinate our production schedules to prevent stockouts and oversupply.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

--------------------- Round 4 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [24, 40, 40, 100]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have sufficient inventory (51 units) and no backlog (0 units) at the moment. My current profit is $1.50. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 51 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to meet current demand without issues.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have sufficient inventory and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are currently stable, we need to coordinate our orders to avoid future fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 16 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill large orders without coordinating with the Distributor.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have sufficient inventory and no backlog, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are currently stable, my situation is critical with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units. This backlog is a significant risk to my profit trajectory of $105.50, as it incurs additional costs. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure that we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or further backlogs. We need to align our expected demand and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the current backlog and expected demand while coordinating closely with the Wholesaler and Retailer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders without coordination.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Distributor said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which is a significant risk to their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more closely to prevent further backlogs and stock-outs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or additional backlogs.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to produce based on the current backlog and expected demand while coordinating closely with all agents.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 18 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders without coordination.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 51 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [24]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 16 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 11, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 39 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [24, 26, 24]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [100]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (39 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have sufficient inventory (51 units) and no backlog (0 units) at the moment. My current profit is $1.50. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have sufficient inventory and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are currently stable, we need to coordinate our orders to avoid future fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have sufficient inventory and no backlog, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are currently stable, my situation is critical with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units. This backlog is a significant risk to my profit trajectory of $105.50, as it incurs additional costs. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure that we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or further backlogs. We need to align our expected demand and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Distributor said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which is a significant risk to their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more closely to prevent further backlogs and stock-outs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or additional backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 18 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 10, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [58]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 38
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (18 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have sufficient inventory (51 units) and no backlog (0 units) at the moment. My current profit is $1.50. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to maintain a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have sufficient inventory and no backlog, emphasizing the importance of collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are currently stable, we need to coordinate our orders to avoid future fluctuations that could threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our strategies and maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have sufficient inventory and no backlog, and the Wholesaler emphasized the need for collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are currently stable, my situation is critical with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units. This backlog is a significant risk to my profit trajectory of $105.50, as it incurs additional costs. Therefore, I will propose that we coordinate our orders more closely to ensure that we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or further backlogs. We need to align our expected demand and order quantities to maintain a steady flow of products and avoid the bullwhip effect that could destabilize our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint order strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Distributor said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 39 units, which is a significant risk to their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders more closely to prevent further backlogs and stock-outs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our expected demand forecasts and align our production schedules to ensure we can meet demand without creating excess inventory or additional backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy that considers our current inventory and expected demand to optimize our supply chain and profits, ensuring we avoid stock-outs and oversupply.
