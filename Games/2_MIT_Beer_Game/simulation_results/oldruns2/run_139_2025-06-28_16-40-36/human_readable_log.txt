--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 15
Orders received per agent: [15, 10, 10, 10]
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units. My profit so far is $17.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover my backlog and expected demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog and expected demand while monitoring the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, which affects my ability to meet customer demand and impacts the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover the expected demand and maintain a buffer against fluctuations, while also urging everyone to communicate their order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover expected demand while maintaining minimal backlog and inventory costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and forecasts to align our strategies and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, stating the importance of aligning our orders to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about our order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover the expected demand while ensuring I can ship only what is necessary to avoid excess inventory and backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover expected demand while maintaining minimal backlog and inventory costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, highlighting the importance of aligning our orders to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding excess stock that could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the expected demand of 10 units, considering my current inventory is 0 and I have no backlog. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce enough to cover the expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels to avoid excess.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 5 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (5 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units. My profit so far is $17.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover my backlog and expected demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.

I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, highlighting the importance of aligning our orders to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding excess stock that could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the expected demand of 10 units, considering my current inventory is 0 and I have no backlog. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units. My profit so far is $17.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stock-outs, which can destabilize the entire supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover my backlog and expected demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to align our strategies and avoid stock-outs or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover the expected demand and maintain a buffer against fluctuations, while also urging everyone to communicate their order quantities to prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and forecasts to align our strategies and ensure we all remain profitable.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, stating the importance of aligning our orders to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious about our order quantities to prevent stockouts and maintain profitability. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover the expected demand while ensuring I can ship only what is necessary to avoid excess inventory and backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order quantities to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 5 units, emphasizing the need for careful coordination to avoid stock-outs. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor echoing this sentiment, highlighting the importance of aligning our orders to meet demand without oversupplying. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we all have enough inventory to meet demand while avoiding excess stock that could hurt our profits. Therefore, I will schedule production to cover the expected demand of 10 units, considering my current inventory is 0 and I have no backlog. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and order quantities to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying, which will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-3.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 14 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better match supply with demand across the chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog and expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 14 units, which impacts my ability to fulfill customer orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Given my current profit of $25.00 and my inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 0 units, I recognize the urgency of aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we do not face stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover expected demand while maintaining minimal backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the urgency of aligning our strategies to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 14 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (14 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-3.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 14 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better match supply with demand across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Given my current profit of $25.00 and my inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 0 units, I recognize the urgency of aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we do not face stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the urgency of aligning our strategies to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential bullwhip effect. My current profit is $25.00, and I have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders. We need to be cautious about stock-outs, as they threaten our profits and could lead to market instability. I can only ship what I receive in orders plus my backlog, so timely coordination is crucial.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the urgency of aligning our strategies to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. My current profit is $-3.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 14 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to further losses. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our ordering strategies to prevent a bullwhip effect and ensure we all remain profitable. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to better match supply with demand across the chain.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. Given my current profit of $25.00 and my inventory status of 0 units with a backlog of 0 units, I recognize the urgency of aligning our strategies. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure we do not face stock-outs or oversupply, which could destabilize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stock-outs and maintain a steady flow of products. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the urgency of aligning our strategies to prevent stock-outs or oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a stable supply chain and maximize our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent any potential bullwhip effect. My current profit is $25.00, and I have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which impacts my ability to fulfill orders. We need to be cautious about stock-outs, as they threaten our profits and could lead to market instability. I can only ship what I receive in orders plus my backlog, so timely coordination is crucial.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-8.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid excess backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 9, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 26
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-8.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid excess backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain and expressed concerns about their backlog of 20 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our efforts and minimize costs for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure a steady supply and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant risks with our current backlogs and inventory levels. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-8.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid excess backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain and expressed concerns about their backlog of 20 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our efforts and minimize costs for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure a steady supply and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant risks with our current backlogs and inventory levels. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.

          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-8.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 20 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid excess backlog costs.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain and minimize costs for everyone.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain and expressed concerns about their backlog of 20 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stockouts and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities transparently to align our efforts and minimize costs for everyone involved.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs, and the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to ensure a steady supply and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all face significant risks with our current backlogs and inventory levels. I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stock-outs if demand increases unexpectedly. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities regularly to optimize our supply chain and prevent the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's agree to communicate our expected demand and order quantities transparently to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid stock-outs and excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand trends while considering my current backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 26 units, which is impacting my profit trajectory negatively at $-47.50.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs and emphasized the importance of aligning orders with actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory and backlog situations to prevent excess costs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to align our strategies and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between fulfilling orders and managing inventory to avoid backlog costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain performance together.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases. My total profit so far is $50.00, and I am concerned about the impact of any stockouts on our collective profits.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of monitoring inventory and backlog to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to align our strategies and optimize our supply chain performance together. My current profit is $50.00, but with 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. We need to be cautious about our ordering to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a balance between fulfilling orders and managing inventory to avoid backlog costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain performance together.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts me at risk of stockouts if demand increases.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of monitoring inventory and backlog to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover the current backlog of 10 units while considering the recent demand trends to avoid oversupply and maintain profitability.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing enough to cover backlog while being cautious of future demand fluctuations.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules more frequently to align our strategies and optimize our supply chain performance together.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which is impacting my profit trajectory negatively at $-5.00. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog.

        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs and emphasized the importance of aligning orders with actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory and backlog situations to prevent excess costs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to align our strategies and minimize costs across the supply chain.

- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of monitoring inventory and backlog to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to align our strategies and optimize our supply chain performance together. My current profit is $50.00, but with 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. We need to be cautious about our ordering to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt everyone's profits.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of monitoring inventory and backlog to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover the current backlog of 10 units while considering the recent demand trends to avoid oversupply and maintain profitability.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs and emphasized the importance of aligning orders with actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory and backlog situations to prevent excess costs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to align our strategies and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain performance together.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of monitoring inventory and backlog to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to align our strategies and optimize our supply chain performance together. My current profit is $50.00, but with 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. We need to be cautious about our ordering to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain performance together.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of monitoring inventory and backlog to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover the current backlog of 10 units while considering the recent demand trends to avoid oversupply and maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules more frequently to align our strategies and optimize our supply chain performance together.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of sharing demand forecasts and adjusting our orders accordingly to maintain a steady flow of products.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can minimize costs across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better coordination to avoid stock-outs and emphasized the importance of aligning orders with actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our inventory and backlog situations to prevent excess costs and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to align our strategies and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain performance together.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of monitoring inventory and backlog to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities more frequently to align our strategies and optimize our supply chain performance together. My current profit is $50.00, but with 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, I am at risk of stockouts if demand increases. We need to be cautious about our ordering to prevent a collapse in our supply chain, which would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and order quantities, ensuring we are all aligned and can optimize our supply chain performance together.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to align our orders more closely with actual demand to prevent excess backlog and holding costs. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the importance of monitoring inventory and backlog to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders to ensure a steady flow of products and minimize costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover the current backlog of 10 units while considering the recent demand trends to avoid oversupply and maintain profitability.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and production schedules more frequently to align our strategies and optimize our supply chain performance together.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain and that they have a backlog of 28 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply, as my current inventory is at 0 units and I have no backlog. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect, which could destabilize our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my inventory and backlog situation.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 28 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 6, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 36
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (28 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that collaboration is key to maintaining a stable supply chain. My current profit is $-64.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 28 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-120.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 37 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be ordering to cover my backlog and expected demand, and I encourage everyone to communicate their order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on my backlog and expected demand to prevent stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 37 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and that they have a backlog of 37 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover expected demand while considering my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 0 units.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to meet expected demand while maintaining minimal backlog and inventory costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, and my total profit so far is $75.00.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the importance of careful order management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent excessive backlog and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover my backlog and align with the Wholesaler's order while being mindful of the Retailer's situation.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to meet my backlog while considering the overall supply chain dynamics.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying and to stabilize our profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill downstream demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of careful order management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to prevent excessive backlog and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 5 units this round to cover potential demand while keeping my inventory at a healthy level.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on producing to meet expected demand while maintaining minimal backlog and inventory costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying.
  Information Shared: I currently have 10 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which allows me to produce effectively without risking excess stock.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 37 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 12, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (37 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-120.00, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 37 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. Therefore, I will be ordering to cover my backlog and expected demand, and I encourage everyone to communicate their order quantities to avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us and that they have a backlog of 37 units, which threatens their ability to meet customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and oversupply, which could destabilize the entire supply chain. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover expected demand while considering my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 0 units.
  Proposal: Let's align our order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the importance of careful order management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to prevent excessive backlog and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover my backlog and align with the Wholesaler's order while being mindful of the Retailer's situation.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying and to stabilize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of careful order management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to prevent excessive backlog and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 5 units this round to cover potential demand while keeping my inventory at a healthy level.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying.

Therefore, I will order 5 units to cover my backlog and align with the Wholesaler's order while being mindful of the Retailer's situation.
  Proposal: Let's share our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying and to stabilize our profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying. I also heard the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of careful order management to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our production schedules to prevent excessive backlog and maintain steady inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will produce 5 units this round to cover potential demand while keeping my inventory at a healthy level.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our production and order quantities based on our current inventory and backlog situations to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure we can meet demand without oversupplying.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 10 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-149.00. This situation threatens not only my profitability but also the stability of the entire supply chain. If I cannot meet customer demand, it could lead to stock-outs and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of us. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. We need to avoid the bullwhip effect by sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so timely communication is crucial. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse that would hurt everyone's profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and avoid stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is affecting my profit.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said that they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and avoid oversupply, which could lead to increased holding costs for all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog and the need to support the Retailer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which affects my ability to fulfill orders and impacts the entire supply chain.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need for effective coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and maintain supply chain stability. My current profit is $45.00, and with 0 units in inventory and no backlog, I am in a position where I need to be cautious about future demand to avoid stock-outs that could hurt all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning orders based on shared demand forecasts to prevent stock-outs and maintain profitability.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which means I need to be strategic about my next order to avoid future stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 36 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 46
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (36 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-149.00. This situation threatens not only my profitability but also the stability of the entire supply chain. If I cannot meet customer demand, it could lead to stock-outs and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of us. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. We need to avoid the bullwhip effect by sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so timely communication is crucial. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse that would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and avoid oversupply, which could lead to increased holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need for effective coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and maintain supply chain stability. My current profit is $45.00, and with 0 units in inventory and no backlog, I am in a position where I need to be cautious about future demand to avoid stock-outs that could hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need for effective coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid excessive backlog costs that threaten all our profits. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover the expected demand while keeping my inventory levels in check, and I encourage everyone to share their demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-149.00. This situation threatens not only my profitability but also the stability of the entire supply chain. If I cannot meet customer demand, it could lead to stock-outs and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of us. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. We need to avoid the bullwhip effect by sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so timely communication is crucial. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse that would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and avoid oversupply, which could lead to increased holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need for effective coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and maintain supply chain stability. My current profit is $45.00, and with 0 units in inventory and no backlog, I am in a position where I need to be cautious about future demand to avoid stock-outs that could hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need for effective coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid excessive backlog costs that threaten all our profits. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover the expected demand while keeping my inventory levels in check, and I encourage everyone to share their demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-149.00. This situation threatens not only my profitability but also the stability of the entire supply chain. If I cannot meet customer demand, it could lead to stock-outs and increased backlog costs, which will hurt all of us. Therefore, I propose that we coordinate our orders more effectively to ensure we meet demand without oversupplying. We need to avoid the bullwhip effect by sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels. I can only ship orders equal to the downstream order plus my backlog, so timely communication is crucial. Let's work together to maintain a steady flow and prevent any market collapse that would hurt everyone's profits.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and avoid stock-outs.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said that they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent stock-outs and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and avoid oversupply, which could lead to increased holding costs for all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need for effective coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our orders to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid excessive backlog costs. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and maintain supply chain stability. My current profit is $45.00, and with 0 units in inventory and no backlog, I am in a position where I need to be cautious about future demand to avoid stock-outs that could hurt all of us.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 36 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need for effective coordination to prevent stock-outs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure a steady flow of products and avoid excessive backlog costs that threaten all our profits. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover the expected demand while keeping my inventory levels in check, and I encourage everyone to share their demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders and prevent stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we align our orders and prevent stock-outs.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-210.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 41 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order enough to cover my backlog and expected demand, while encouraging everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 41 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill customer demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog and expected demand while maintaining communication with all agents.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 10 units, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stock-outs.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts. Therefore, I will order 5 units to maintain a buffer for future demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer while encouraging coordination among all agents.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill orders and could lead to stock-outs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to avoid costly excess stock or stock-outs. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to cover the expected demand and maintain a healthy balance in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will produce enough to meet expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our production efforts and minimize costs across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog, which puts pressure on my ability to fulfill future orders and could lead to stock-outs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 41 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 5]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 46
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (41 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-210.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 41 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order enough to cover my backlog and expected demand, while encouraging everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts. Therefore, I will order 5 units to maintain a buffer for future demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to avoid costly excess stock or stock-outs. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to cover the expected demand and maintain a healthy balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our production efforts and minimize costs across the supply chain.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-210.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 41 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order enough to cover my backlog and expected demand, while encouraging everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts. Therefore, I will order 5 units to maintain a buffer for future demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to avoid costly excess stock or stock-outs. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to cover the expected demand and maintain a healthy balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our production efforts and minimize costs across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial for all of us. My current profit is $-210.50, and I have 0 units in inventory with a backlog of 41 units. This situation threatens my ability to meet customer demand and could lead to stock-outs, which would negatively impact all of our profits. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Therefore, I will order enough to cover my backlog and expected demand, while encouraging everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid oversupply or stock-outs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must align our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply, which threaten our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to share our demand forecasts and order quantities to optimize our supply chain efforts. Therefore, I will order 5 units to maintain a buffer for future demand, but I urge everyone to communicate their needs clearly to avoid stock-outs or oversupply, which could threaten our profits.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a joint strategy to align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to maximize total supply chain profits.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent the bullwhip effect and ensure a steady flow of products. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning our order quantities to avoid stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all be aware of our current inventory and backlog situations to avoid costly excess stock or stock-outs. Therefore, I will produce 10 units this round to cover the expected demand and maintain a healthy balance in the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our production efforts and minimize costs across the supply chain.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-296.00. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on expected demand while considering my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our supply chain efforts and minimize costs.
  Information Shared: I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units, which affects my ability to meet customer demand and impacts our overall profits.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $70.00, but with my inventory at 0 units and no backlog, I am at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could further destabilize our supply chain. We must work together to maintain steady flow and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 57 units, which is significantly impacting their profit trajectory. I also hear the Wholesaler express concern about their ability to fulfill future orders due to having 0 units in inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain and prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect. My current profit is $70.00, but with my inventory at 0 units and no backlog, I am at risk of not fulfilling future orders, which could further destabilize our supply chain. We must work together to maintain a steady flow and avoid excess holding or backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning our orders based on shared demand forecasts to stabilize the supply chain.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 57 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 5, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (57 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 0, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 57 units, which is significantly impacting my profit trajectory, currently at $-296.00. I hear no previous messages from other agents, so I want to emphasize the importance of our collaboration to prevent stock-outs and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to stabilize the supply chain. Therefore, I will propose that we share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are all aligned and can avoid the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-399.50, which is a significant concern. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 69 units, indicating a critical need to fulfill customer demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and increased backlog costs, which will further impact our profits. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent any oversupply or stock-out situations. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover the backlog and expected demand to avoid stock-outs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 69 units, which is critical for our supply chain stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 69 units, which indicates a critical need to fulfill customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate effectively to prevent stock-outs and increased backlog costs that could further impact our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities to cover the Retailer's backlog while considering my current inventory of 0 units and the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover the expected demand while ensuring I do not overestimate and incur holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on order quantities that will fulfill the Retailer's backlog and stabilize our supply chain, preventing stock-outs and oversupply.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 0 units, which highlights the need for immediate action to maintain supply chain stability.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 69 units, which indicates a critical need to fulfill customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that we can meet the Retailer's demand while avoiding excessive inventory and backlog costs. Therefore, I will place an order of 5 units to the Factory to maintain a buffer for future demand, while also ensuring that I can ship the necessary amount to the Wholesaler based on their order and my current backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to maintain a buffer for future demand while ensuring I do not overestimate and incur holding costs.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 69 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [5, 16, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 67
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (69 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 0, 0]

          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-399.50, which is a significant concern. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 69 units, indicating a critical need to fulfill customer demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and increased backlog costs, which will further impact our profits. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent any oversupply or stock-out situations. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 69 units, which indicates a critical need to fulfill customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate effectively to prevent stock-outs and increased backlog costs that could further impact our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities to cover the Retailer's backlog while considering my current inventory of 0 units and the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on order quantities that will fulfill the Retailer's backlog and stabilize our supply chain, preventing stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 69 units, which indicates a critical need to fulfill customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that we can meet the Retailer's demand while avoiding excessive inventory and backlog costs. Therefore, I will place an order of 5 units to the Factory to maintain a buffer for future demand, while also ensuring that I can ship the necessary amount to the Wholesaler based on their order and my current backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on order quantities that will fulfill the Retailer's backlog and stabilize our supply chain, preventing stock-outs and oversupply.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 69 units, which indicates a critical need to fulfill customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasizing the importance of coordinating our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that we can meet the Retailer's demand while avoiding excessive inventory and backlog costs. Therefore, I will produce enough to cover the backlog and expected demand while being mindful of my current inventory of 0 units and backlog of 10 units. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's align our production and order quantities to fulfill the Retailer's backlog and maintain supply chain stability.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round. Based on my current situation, I want to highlight that my profit is currently at $-399.50, which is a significant concern. I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 69 units, indicating a critical need to fulfill customer demand. If we do not coordinate effectively, we risk stock-outs and increased backlog costs, which will further impact our profits. Therefore, I propose that we all share our demand forecasts and order quantities to ensure we are aligned and can prevent any oversupply or stock-out situations. This will help stabilize the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts and prevent stock-outs or oversupply.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 69 units, which indicates a critical need to fulfill customer demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate effectively to prevent stock-outs and increased backlog costs that could further impact our profits. Therefore, I will propose that we align our order quantities to cover the Retailer's backlog while considering my current inventory of 0 units and the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's agree on order quantities that will fulfill the Retailer's backlog and stabilize our supply chain, preventing stock-outs and oversupply.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they have a backlog of 69 units, which indicates a critical need to fulfill customer demand. I also hear the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of coordinating our order quantities to prevent stock-outs and increased backlog costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must work together to ensure that we can meet the Retailer's demand while avoiding excessive inventory and backlog costs. Therefore, I will place an order of 5 units to the Factory to maintain a buffer for future demand, while also ensuring that I can ship the necessary amount to the Wholesaler based on their order and my current backlog.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [0, 10, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $2.5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $2.5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 9. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [0, 10, 0]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Total profit so far: $10.00
          - Current strategy: {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 10,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "To maintain a balance between production and demand, I will produce enough to cover potential demand while keeping inventory levels healthy.",
  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of overproducing if demand fluctuates unexpectedly, leading to excess holding costs.",
  "d_demand_next_round": 5,
  "order_quantity": 5
}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        
        Other agents in the supply chain: Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($10.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (10 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

ROLE SPECIALTY: You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 10 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $2.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $2.5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:
