I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 10 units each to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs. My current inventory is 0 units and I have a backlog of 28 units, which puts pressure on my production capacity. Therefore, I will schedule production of 38 units this round to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand from the downstream partners.
