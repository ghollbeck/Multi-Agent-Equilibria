Wholesaler and Retailer both planning 20-unit orders to build 10-unit safety stocks. Factory scheduling 25 units to help clear backlogs. My status remains concerning: Balance down to $897.50 (-$52.50 last round), 0 inventory, 10-unit backlog costing $15/round. ANALYSIS: 1) Chain-wide backlog (28 units) costing $42/round total 2) Everyone's profits declining dangerously 3) Zero inventories across chain leave no buffer 4) True demand (9.6 avg) getting amplified into costly swings. URGENT ACTION: I'll order 25 units this round: 10 for backlog + 10 safety stock + 5 extra buffer given upstream volatility. Yes, this means $12.50/round holding cost when fully stocked, but prevents $15/round backlog costs and provides stability. COORDINATION IMPERATIVE: 1) Everyone maintain 10-unit minimum safety stock 2) Order based on true demand (10) plus small buffer 3) Share inventory/backlog status every round 4) Avoid panic ordering that amplifies swings. CRITICAL REMINDER: I can only ship what Wholesaler orders plus their backlog. With 1-round lead time, we must order proactively but smartly.

As Factory, I confirm I can maintain 20-unit production to support recovery without creating excess inventory costs.",
      "strategy_hint": "Will maintain 20-unit production schedule: 15 units matching downstream baseline plus 5 extra to gradually clear backlogs. This balances increased supply needs with sustainable production levels and inventory management.",
      "collaboration_proposal": "FACTORY RECOVERY PLAN: 1) I commit to 20-unit production for 4-5 rounds 2) All maintain 15-unit baseline orders to ensure smooth flow 3) Share daily profit/inventory updates 4) Once Retailer stabilizes, gradually reduce to 12-15 unit steady state 5) Implement strict \u00b120% production/order variation limits 6) Any agent seeing critical balance decline must alert chain immediately",
      "information_shared": "Current state: Balance $840 (down 20% from peak), 0 inventory, 10 unit backlog, last production 15 units, seeing alternating profit pattern (+$50/-$15), production lead time 1 round, holding cost $0.5/unit, backlog cost $1.5/unit, profit $2.5/unit sold. Recent demand pattern shows consistent 10-unit base with gaps. CRITICAL: My production decisions directly impact entire chain stability.",
