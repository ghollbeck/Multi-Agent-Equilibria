Given the recent demand pattern, I plan to order a range of 10-15 units from the Distributor this round to try to meet the Retailer's orders and build some inventory buffer. I hear the Retailer suggested we all aim for a shared target inventory level of 10-15 units across the supply chain to balance supply and demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that coordinating our ordering and production targets could improve profitability for the entire chain. Therefore, I propose we collectively target a 10-15 unit inventory level across the supply chain to efficiently meet customer demand and reduce backlogs.

My goal is to maintain a safety stock of around 5-10 units to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs. I acknowledge the Wholesaler's previous message about their inventory constraints. Based on this, I suggest we collectively aim for a target inventory level of 20-30 units across the supply chain to meet demand reliably.

My general ordering approach is to target a safety stock level to meet expected demand while minimizing holding and backlog costs. Based on the recent demand of 10 units, I plan to order between 10-15 units from the Distributor this round. I believe we should coordinate to maintain inventory levels that can reliably fulfill orders across the supply chain, while also minimizing costs. Perhaps we could agree on a target safety stock range of 10-20 units for the Wholesaler role to help stabilize the system. I'm open to discussing other collaborative strategies that could benefit the entire supply chain.",
