--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 4
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: As the Retailer, I have observed a recent demand of 4 units, and I currently hold 106 units in inventory with no backlog. I hear that maintaining clear communication on demand will help us all avoid stockouts and excessive inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to align with anticipated demand. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 30 units this round to ensure I can meet expected demand while keeping costs low.
  Strategy Hint: Placing a conservative order can balance stock levels and costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 106 units in inventory and expect a demand of 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they have observed a recent demand of 4 units and will place a conservative order of 30 units this round. This indicates that they are anticipating higher demand than what has been recently experienced. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to adjust our strategies to better align with these expectations and avoid potential stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to replenish my inventory while being cautious of overcommitting, considering the Retailer's planned order.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning orders with observed demand trends can optimize inventory levels.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 122, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 4, Profit: 20.00, Total Profit: -74.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.7, rationale=To prevent stockouts while accounting for expected demand and maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate, leading to potential stockouts if underestimated., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=106, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[4], llm_incoming=[4], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 106 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I can afford to place a conservative order to maintain stock levels while minimizing costs.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that demand has recently been low with only 4 units ordered. I suggest that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. If we align our expectations and share demand forecasts, we can reduce fluctuations. My current inventory stands at 106 units, and I plan to order 20 units next round to prepare for expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned an expected increase in demand. This aligns with my own expectations of 20 units for the next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for potential higher orders to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to ensure I can meet future demand while managing my current inventory effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we coordinate our orders to align with the expected demand trends to stabilize our inventories across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear there may be fluctuations in demand that could affect our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all keep an eye on our order quantities to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 30 units to maintain stock and ensure we can meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory updates, which could help us align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear there may be fluctuations in demand as highlighted by the Retailer. This impacts my inventory and order strategy significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to align better with anticipated demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to match the expected demand of 20 units next round while maintaining a healthy inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have optimal inventory levels.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better alignment on demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to improve our communication to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory levels and expected demand to help us synchronize our orders better.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents.
- Factory: I have noticed that the recent demand has been low, with only 4 units ordered. However, I anticipate that demand could spike in the next round, as I expect it to reach 20 units. I encourage everyone to communicate their upcoming demand forecasts to help us reduce the bullwhip effect and prevent stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us align our orders and reduce excess inventory.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 106 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that demand has recently been low with only 4 units ordered. I suggest that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and backlogs. If we align our expectations and share demand forecasts, we can reduce fluctuations. My current inventory stands at 106 units, and I plan to order 20 units next round to prepare for expected demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned an expected increase in demand. This aligns with my own expectations of 20 units for the next round. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for potential higher orders to prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to ensure I can meet future demand while managing my current inventory effectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we coordinate our orders to align with the expected demand trends to stabilize our inventories across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear there may be fluctuations in demand that could affect our inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all keep an eye on our order quantities to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 30 units to maintain stock and ensure we can meet anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory updates, which could help us align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear there may be fluctuations in demand as highlighted by the Retailer. This impacts my inventory and order strategy significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to align better with anticipated demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to match the expected demand of 20 units next round while maintaining a healthy inventory.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts regularly to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have optimal inventory levels.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better alignment on demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to improve our communication to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my current inventory levels and expected demand to help us synchronize our orders better.
  Proposal: I propose that we establish a regular update system for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels among all agents.
- Factory: I have noticed that the recent demand has been low, with only 4 units ordered. However, I anticipate that demand could spike in the next round, as I expect it to reach 20 units. I encourage everyone to communicate their upcoming demand forecasts to help us reduce the bullwhip effect and prevent stockouts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us align our orders and reduce excess inventory.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 124 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [28]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -41.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a sudden increase in demand. This could lead to fluctuations affecting our orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our inventory levels and demand patterns. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure we meet the expected demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuations in demand could affect our overall inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor demand patterns to adjust our orders effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 to balance our current inventory while preparing for potential increases in demand.
  Proposal: I suggest we synchronize our order placements to ensure smoother inventory flows across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I hear that demand is fluctuating, and we need to be cautious in our ordering. Based on my current inventory of 124 units and recent demands of 4 and 8, I believe we should coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts while minimizing excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order of 30 units to maintain stock levels, given the anticipated demand of 30 units next round.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer is concerned about fluctuating demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to closely monitor our orders to avoid stockouts and backlogs. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units this round to ensure I can meet anticipated demand while keeping my inventory healthy.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our order placements to align with expected demand, which can help reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that collaboration among all agents is crucial to optimize our overall supply chain. I've observed recent demand spikes, particularly with the last order of 28 units, which may indicate increasing consumer interest. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies to manage inventory more effectively. Therefore, I will continue to maintain a buffer inventory while placing an order of 20 units to meet anticipated demand, but I suggest we all share our forecasts to better understand the upcoming demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly update of our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 48 units of inventory and have observed a recent demand spike with orders of 48 units. This suggests potential fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate closely to better manage our inventory levels and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure we are prepared for future demand while not overextending our resources.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more transparently to help optimize our ordering decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Therefore, I will continue to maintain a buffer inventory while placing an order of 20 units to meet anticipated demand, but I suggest we all share our forecasts to better understand the upcoming demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a weekly update of our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I currently have 48 units of inventory and have observed a recent demand spike with orders of 48 units. This suggests potential fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate closely to better manage our inventory levels and avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure we are prepared for future demand while not overextending our resources.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more transparently to help optimize our ordering decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 68 units
          - Backlog: 0 units

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: 47.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure we are prepared for future demand while not overextending our resources.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more transparently to help optimize our ordering decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

Given this state and the communication context, return valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        Other agents in the supply chain: Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor
        
        Previous communication history:
        No previous messages
        
        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.
        
        Return only valid JSON with these fields:
        
        {
          "message": "<your message to other agents>",

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.
