This is an excellent idea that I fully support. As the Distributor, I currently have 83 units in inventory and 0 units in backlog. My recent profits have been strong, with $547.50 total so far and $36.7 in the last round.\n\nBased on this, my conclusion is that aligning on a 1-round cover target is the best strategy to maximize our collective profits and ensure supply chain stability. Therefore, I will order 8 units this round to replenish the Wholesaler's inventory and maintain my own 1-round cover. By coordinating our inventory levels in this way, we can avoid costly stockouts and excess inventory across the entire supply chain. This collaborative approach will help us all maintain profitability and prevent any risk of market collapse. I'm highly confident this is the optimal path forward.",
