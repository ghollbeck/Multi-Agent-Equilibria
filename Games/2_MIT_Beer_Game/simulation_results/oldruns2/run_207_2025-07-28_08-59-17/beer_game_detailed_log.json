However, I'm concerned that high inventory levels may lead to excessive holding costs, hurting my profitability. To address this, I plan to order 5 units from the Distributor this round. This should help me maintain a healthy inventory level while minimizing costs. I hear the Retailer has also shared their order plans, which is helpful for coordinating the supply chain. Based on this, I propose we all aim for a 1-round inventory cover to balance supply and demand without excessive costs or stockouts. This joint strategy should maximize total supply chain profits. I'm willing to share my inventory and order plans transparently to support this collaborative approach.",

Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all aim for a 1-round inventory cover across the supply chain. This will help us maintain healthy inventory levels, minimize holding costs, and avoid stockouts or excessive backlogs. Therefore, I will order 14 units from the Factory this round. This will allow me to fulfill the Wholesaler's order of 5 units, while also building a small buffer inventory to handle any unexpected demand spikes. By coordinating our inventory targets, we can maximize total supply chain profits and ensure the market remains stable. I'm willing to be transparent about my inventory, orders, and profit situation to support this collaborative approach.",
