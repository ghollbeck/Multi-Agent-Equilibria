--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 16
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock while anticipating a slight increase in demand.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining inventory levels while being responsive to demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand at 16 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and proposed to align on expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while considering the recent demand of 16 units.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts while being responsive to demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand at 16 units.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. I also note that the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing caution with orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our inventory levels and demand forecasts to optimize our orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet potential demand while avoiding backlog costs.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer to meet demand while being cautious with my orders.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand at 16 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to maintain a balance between inventory and demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units to keep a buffer while being mindful of potential demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining a buffer to meet potential demand while being cautious with my orders.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=To maintain inventory and meet expected demand, I will order 20 units., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations could lead to excess inventory or stockouts if not managed., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=34, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[16], llm_incoming=[16], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."

        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock while anticipating a slight increase in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and proposed to align on expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while considering the recent demand of 16 units.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. I also note that the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing caution with orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our inventory levels and demand forecasts to optimize our orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet potential demand while avoiding backlog costs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to maintain a balance between inventory and demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units to keep a buffer while being mindful of potential demand fluctuations.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock while anticipating a slight increase in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and proposed to align on expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while considering the recent demand of 16 units.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. I also note that the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing caution with orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our inventory levels and demand forecasts to optimize our orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet potential demand while avoiding backlog costs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to maintain a balance between inventory and demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units to keep a buffer while being mindful of potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better demand forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain my stock while anticipating a slight increase in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the need for better demand forecasting and proposed to align on expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while considering the recent demand of 16 units.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. I also note that the Wholesaler echoed this sentiment, emphasizing caution with orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our inventory levels and demand forecasts to optimize our orders. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to ensure I can meet potential demand while avoiding backlog costs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should align on expected demand to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this sentiment. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to maintain a balance between inventory and demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units to keep a buffer while being mindful of potential demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration

        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 9 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet future demand effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 25 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders promptly.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 9 units, suggesting a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible higher demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand while managing my inventory effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the expected demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 5 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to fulfill larger orders immediately.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 29 units, suggesting a potential increase in demand. I also note that Wholesaler concluded we should prepare for possible higher demand in the upcoming rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to avoid stockouts and manage our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will adjust my order to meet the anticipated demand while considering my current backlog of 15 units.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the expected demand while managing my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 5 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 9 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet future demand effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 9 units, suggesting a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible higher demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand while managing my inventory effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 29 units, suggesting a potential increase in demand. I also note that Wholesaler concluded we should prepare for possible higher demand in the upcoming rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to avoid stockouts and manage our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will adjust my order to meet the anticipated demand while considering my current backlog of 15 units.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 9 units, suggesting a potential increase in demand. I also note that Wholesaler concluded we should prepare for possible higher demand in the upcoming rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about our order quantities to avoid stockouts. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with the anticipated demand while considering my current backlog of 20 units.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 15 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (15 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 9 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet future demand effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 9 units, suggesting a potential increase in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for possible higher demand in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this anticipated demand while managing my inventory effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 16 and 29 units, suggesting a potential increase in demand. I also note that Wholesaler concluded we should prepare for possible higher demand in the upcoming rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to avoid stockouts and manage our inventory effectively. Therefore, I will adjust my order to meet the anticipated demand while considering my current backlog of 15 units.

        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration

        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [16, 16, 16, 32]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to align with anticipated demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while managing my inventory carefully.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 32 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging around 11.33 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of monitoring order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders more closely with anticipated demand to optimize our supply chain. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand patterns while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order accuracy.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 8 units and no inventory, which limits my ability to fulfill orders beyond this backlog.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the need to align orders with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all coordinate our orders more effectively to manage our backlogs and inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 40 units.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on expected demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order accuracy.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 40 units and no inventory, which limits my ability to fulfill orders beyond this backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the need to align orders with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to manage our backlogs and inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog of 38 units.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand while managing my backlog effectively.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order accuracy.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have no inventory and a backlog of 38 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders beyond this backlog.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 32 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [21]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Retailer",
          "inventory": 50,

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 8 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (8 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to align with anticipated demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of monitoring order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders more closely with anticipated demand to optimize our supply chain. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order accuracy.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the need to align orders with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all coordinate our orders more effectively to manage our backlogs and inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 40 units.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order accuracy.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the need to align orders with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to manage our backlogs and inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog of 38 units.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order accuracy.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 38 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 34, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [54]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 54
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (38 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity to align with anticipated demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned the importance of monitoring order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders more closely with anticipated demand to optimize our supply chain. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order accuracy.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the need to align orders with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all coordinate our orders more effectively to manage our backlogs and inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the expected demand while considering my current backlog of 40 units.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect and improve our order accuracy.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory or stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the need to align orders with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders more effectively to manage our backlogs and inventory levels.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

--------------------- Round 4 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 13
Shipments received per agent: [29, 34, 34, 108]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with the last three orders being 9, 9, and 13 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this rising demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 48 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations and plan to adjust their order to meet rising demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for potential increases in demand. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and the recent demand trends to ensure we can meet our commitments without overextending our inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on my backlog and recent demand patterns to balance supply and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 7 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders beyond this backlog.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations and plan to adjust their order to meet rising demand. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need to be cautious about over-ordering while preparing for potential increases in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and the recent demand trends, while also considering the constraints of shipping only what is needed to meet orders and backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I will order to cover my backlog while being mindful of potential demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 60 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders beyond this backlog.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations and plan to adjust their order to meet rising demand. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor mention the need to be cautious about over-ordering while preparing for potential increases in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order to cover my backlog of 26 units while being mindful of the recent demand trends.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on fulfilling backlog while preparing for potential demand increases.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 26 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders beyond this backlog.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 48 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [34]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations and plan to adjust their order to meet rising demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for potential increases in demand. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and the recent demand trends to ensure we can meet our commitments without overextending our inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations and plan to adjust their order to meet rising demand. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need to be cautious about over-ordering while preparing for potential increases in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and the recent demand trends, while also considering the constraints of shipping only what is needed to meet orders and backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations and plan to adjust their order to meet rising demand. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor mention the need to be cautious about over-ordering while preparing for potential increases in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order to cover my backlog of 26 units while being mindful of the recent demand trends.

    LLM Communication System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 60 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 21, 34]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [108]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 62
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (60 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 26 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [34, 16, 34]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [60]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 72
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (26 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has fluctuated, with the last three orders being 9, 9, and 13 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this rising demand while maintaining sufficient inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations and plan to adjust their order to meet rising demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering while still preparing for potential increases in demand. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and the recent demand trends to ensure we can meet our commitments without overextending our inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuations and plan to adjust their order to meet rising demand. I also hear Wholesaler mention the need to be cautious about over-ordering while preparing for potential increases in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and the recent demand trends, while also considering the constraints of shipping only what is needed to meet orders and backlog.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and anticipated demand to maintain balance.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 60 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned ordering conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and anticipated demand to ensure we can meet the needs of the supply chain without overcommitting.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on backlog and expected demand to maintain balance.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have a backlog of 13 units and no inventory, which limits my ability to fulfill orders without careful planning.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 64 units to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 60 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 13
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain stock while anticipating demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential fluctuations in demand could lead to excess inventory or stockouts if not managed carefully.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 20,
  "order_quantity": 20
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and anticipated demand to maintain balance.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned ordering conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and anticipated demand to ensure we can meet the needs of the supply chain without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 64 units to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 22 units to ensure we can meet demand effectively while considering the shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 64 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [21, 34, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [126]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 90
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (64 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and anticipated demand to maintain balance.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned ordering conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and anticipated demand to ensure we can meet the needs of the supply chain without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 64 units to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said we should order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 22 units to ensure we can meet demand effectively while considering the shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (22 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With no backlog and sufficient inventory, I will order to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations while avoiding excess inventory.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and anticipated demand to maintain balance.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned ordering conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and anticipated demand to ensure we can meet the needs of the supply chain without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we should order conservatively to match expected demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 64 units to ensure we can meet demand without overcommitting.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders more closely to align with actual demand and reduce the risk of excess inventory.

I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our orders to prevent backlog issues. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 22 units to ensure we can meet demand effectively while considering the shipment constraints.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 9 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [108]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (9 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more effectively to manage our inventory levels. Therefore, I will order based on my expected demand while considering my current backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the need to align our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to better manage our inventory levels and reduce backlog. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and expected demand while keeping in mind the shipment constraints we face.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the need to align our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to manage our backlog and fulfill demand efficiently. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 94 units to ensure we meet the demand while considering shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [34, 16, 34]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [120]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 84
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (10 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more effectively to manage our inventory levels. Therefore, I will order based on my expected demand while considering my current backlog.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the need to align our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to better manage our inventory levels and reduce backlog. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog and expected demand while keeping in mind the shipment constraints we face.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and current inventory levels to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor our demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler emphasizing the need to align our orders effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to manage our backlog and fulfill demand efficiently. Therefore, I will order based on my current backlog of 94 units to ensure we meet the demand while considering shipment constraints.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while ensuring I have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 94 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more effectively to manage our inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on the recent demand of 9, 10, and 6, while ensuring I can fulfill my backlog.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand data to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 3 units, which limits my ability to fulfill orders beyond that.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our orders more effectively to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will order to maintain a buffer while considering the recent demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand while ensuring I have enough stock to meet potential increases in demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 94 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 3 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [62]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (3 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more effectively to manage our inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand data to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our orders more effectively to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will order to maintain a buffer while considering the recent demand fluctuations.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 106 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 108, 62]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [168]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 202
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (106 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will continue to order based on anticipated demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's share our recent demand data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders more effectively to manage our inventory levels. Therefore, I will adjust my order to better match the recent demand trends while considering my current backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on the recent demand data to minimize the bullwhip effect and ensure we all have sufficient inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor demand patterns to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned the need to align our orders more effectively to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all coordinate our orders based on recent demand trends to minimize the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will order to maintain a buffer while considering the recent demand fluctuations.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I have enough stock to meet anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet expected demand without overcommitting.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 121 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8

    LLM Decision System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 121 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 6, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I have enough stock to meet anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to ensure sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better match the anticipated demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to ensure sufficient stock. I also note that Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to align with this. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aiming to maintain adequate inventory levels to meet demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I can fulfill the expected demand while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we continue to share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize excess inventory.

You are the Wholesaler agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 144 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [34, 32, 20]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [176]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

  "inventory": 50,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I have enough stock to meet anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to ensure sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better match the anticipated demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to ensure sufficient stock. I also note that Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to align with this. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aiming to maintain adequate inventory levels to meet demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I can fulfill the expected demand while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we continue to share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to ensure sufficient stock. I also note that Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 20 units to align with this. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aiming to maintain adequate inventory levels to meet demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I can fulfill the expected demand while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we continue to share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize excess inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 228 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [108, 62, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 206
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. I hear that maintaining inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better match demand patterns. Therefore, I will order 20 units this round to ensure I have enough stock to meet anticipated demand while avoiding excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more regularly to align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to ensure sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better match the anticipated demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to maintain a buffer while fulfilling the Retailer's needs.
  Proposal: I propose we regularly share our demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to ensure sufficient stock. I also note that Wholesaler plans to order 20 units to align with this. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aiming to maintain adequate inventory levels to meet demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I can fulfill the expected demand while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we continue to share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize excess inventory.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will order 20 units this round to ensure sufficient stock. I also note that Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 20 units to align with this. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aiming to maintain adequate inventory levels to meet demand. Therefore, I will order 20 units to ensure I can fulfill the expected demand while keeping a buffer for potential fluctuations.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand without creating excess inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 143 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units and will adjust their order to meet this demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that aligns with the recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I will order based on recent demand patterns while keeping a safety stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 120 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units and will adjust their order to meet this demand. I also hear Wholesaler concluding that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to avoid stockouts while maintaining sufficient inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer and meet potential demand.
  Strategy Hint: I will order conservatively to balance inventory and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 178 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.

        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units and will adjust their order to meet this demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that aligns with the recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units and will adjust their order to meet this demand. I also hear Wholesaler concluding that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to avoid stockouts while maintaining sufficient inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer and meet potential demand.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.

You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 120 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 7, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 178 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [32, 20, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [80]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I have observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units. This suggests a potential increase in demand. Therefore, I will adjust my order to ensure we can meet this demand without creating excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units and will adjust their order to meet this demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order that aligns with the recent demand trends while maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts regularly to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units and will adjust their order to meet this demand. I also hear Wholesaler concluding that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to avoid stockouts while maintaining sufficient inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain a buffer and meet potential demand.

- Factory: I hear Retailer said they observed recent demand fluctuating between 6 to 10 units and will adjust their order to ensure we can meet this demand without creating excess inventory. I also hear Wholesaler concluding that we should all be cautious about over-ordering to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to prevent stockouts while maintaining sufficient inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 10 units to maintain a buffer for potential demand fluctuations.

You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on recent demand trends while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 148 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and backlog while considering the recent demand trends.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
  Information Shared: I currently have 135 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to fulfill orders efficiently.
  Confidence: 0.75
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to closely monitor order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and the recent demand trends, while also considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a buffer while being mindful of recent demand patterns.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and reduce the risk of stockouts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 319 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet upcoming demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to monitor order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to ensure we meet demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while being mindful of the recent demand trends and shipment constraints.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order conservatively to maintain a balance between meeting demand and avoiding excess inventory.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 148 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 10, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [25]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Retailer agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 135 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 10, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and backlog while considering the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to closely monitor order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and the recent demand trends, while also considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to monitor order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to ensure we meet demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while being mindful of the recent demand trends and shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and reduce the risk of stockouts.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all closely monitor our order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and backlog while considering the recent demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned the need to closely monitor order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to prevent overstocking while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will order based on my current inventory and the recent demand trends, while also considering the shipment constraints that limit me to shipping only the amount equal to the Retailer's order plus my backlog.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their order to align with anticipated demand while maintaining sufficient stock. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the need to monitor order patterns to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our orders to ensure we meet demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer in my inventory while being mindful of the recent demand trends and shipment constraints.
  Proposal: Let's coordinate our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and reduce the risk of stockouts.

You are the Distributor agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs

          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 559 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 50, 35]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [35]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        - Information about shipment constraints (you can only ship orders + backlog)
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

    LLM Init System Prompt: 
You are the Factory agent in the MIT Beer Game — a four-stage supply-chain simulation consisting of Retailer → Wholesaler → Distributor → Factory.

Your sole objective is to maximise YOUR cumulative profit across all rounds.  In every round you can:
1. Observe your private state (inventory, backlog, recent orders / demand, incoming shipments, last order placed, last round profit).
2. Decide an *order_quantity* for your upstream partner (Factory schedules production instead of ordering).
3. You may also broadcast one concise message to the other agents before ordering each round.

CRITICAL SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to your downstream partner an amount equal to (their_order + your_current_backlog). You cannot ship more than this even if you have excess inventory. This prevents oversupplying and maintains realistic supply chain constraints.

After a full generation you may be asked to update your ordering strategy based on performance logs.

The upcoming USER message will always provide:
• Current round state and cost parameters (holding cost, backlog cost, profit per unit sold).
• Your current strategy JSON and any relevant hyper-parameters.
• When enabled, a short history of other agents' communications.
• When enabled, a summary of your past memories/experiences.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON that strictly follows the schema specified in the USER message for the current task (strategy_initialization, strategy_update, order_decision, or communication).  Do NOT include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 50 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
          • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
          • SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
          • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 50,
          "backlog": 0,
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,

          "expected_demand_next_round": <integer>,
          "order_quantity": <integer>
        }

        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no markdown, no triple backticks, no code fences, and do NOT write the word 'json' anywhere. Your reply must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else. If you include anything else, your answer will be rejected. KEEP IT RATHER SHORT
