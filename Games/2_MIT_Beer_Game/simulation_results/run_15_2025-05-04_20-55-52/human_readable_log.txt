        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.
        
        Economics:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 27 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 0, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $1.5

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.
        
        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $1.5 per unit sold

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "order_quantity": 10,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "rationale": "With an initial inventory of 20 units and expected demand of 12 units next round, ordering 10 units balances holding and backlog costs while maintaining inventory levels.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential risk of overestimating demand could lead to excess inventory or backlog. However, the order quantity is conservative to mitigate swings.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $1.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
          • You earn $1.5 profit for each unit sold
