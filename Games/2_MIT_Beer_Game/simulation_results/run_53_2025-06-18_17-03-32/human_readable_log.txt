Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 99, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=I will cover expected demand and reduce stockout risk., risk_assessment=Demand may exceed expectations, leading to potential backlog., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=99, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit. Consider:
        
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        
        Be strategic - share information that encourages good collaboration but maintains
        your competitive advantage. Keep messages concise but informative.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]

          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit. Consider:
        
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        
        Be strategic - share information that encourages good collaboration but maintains
        your competitive advantage. Keep messages concise but informative.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 69 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [70]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've observed that demand has been fluctuating recently, with recent orders showing a spike to 40 units. To mitigate the potential bullwhip effect, I recommend we align our order quantities based on a shared demand forecast. This could help stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to better synchronize our orders and inventory management.
- Factory: I've noticed that recent demand patterns have shown significant fluctuations, with orders spiking up to 70 units. To minimize the bullwhip effect, it would be beneficial for us to align our order quantities based on a shared demand forecast. Let's focus on maintaining sufficient inventory to buffer against these fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish regular communication to share our demand forecasts and adjust our orders accordingly, ensuring better alignment across the supply chain.
- Retailer: I've noted that recent demand has been consistent around 10-11 units. To optimize our supply chain and mitigate the bullwhip effect, I propose we coordinate our order quantities based on our collective demand forecasts. This will help us maintain balanced inventory levels across the board.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and synchronize our order placements to achieve better alignment.
- Wholesaler: I've observed steady demand patterns around 10-11 units recently, which suggests a potential for better alignment in our orders. To mitigate the bullwhip effect, I encourage us to synchronize our order quantities based on this consistent demand. Additionally, we should consider sharing our forecasts regularly to optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule to share our demand forecasts and align our orders accordingly.
- Distributor: I've observed recent demand showing fluctuations, with spikes up to 40 units. To mitigate the bullwhip effect, I suggest we coordinate our order quantities based on a shared demand forecast to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts to better synchronize our orders and inventory management.
- Factory: I've noticed recent demand fluctuations with spikes reaching 70 units and a steady base around 10-11 units. To minimize the bullwhip effect, aligning our orders based on these patterns would be beneficial. Let's ensure we maintain sufficient inventory to buffer against sudden demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular cadence for sharing our demand forecasts so we can synchronize our orders effectively.

To minimize the bullwhip effect, aligning our orders based on these patterns would be beneficial. Let's ensure we maintain sufficient inventory to buffer against sudden demand increases.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular cadence for sharing our demand forecasts so we can synchronize our orders effectively.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 19 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 70]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

--------------------- Round 3 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [11, 11, 11, 30]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I've observed a consistent demand pattern averaging around 11 units over the last three rounds. With my current inventory of 98 units, I am well-positioned to meet this demand. However, I recommend that we all closely monitor our inventories to avoid overstocking or backlogs as demand can fluctuate unexpectedly.

I recommend we align our orders closely to the expected demand to mitigate risks.
  Strategy Hint: I suggest ordering quantities that reflect both current backlogs and anticipated demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to better synchronize our supply chain efforts.
  Information Shared: I currently have a backlog of 12 units and have placed an order for 20 units to meet anticipated demand.
  Confidence: 0.7
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I've observed fluctuating demand with recent orders peaking at 70 units. Currently, I have a backlog of 31 units and no inventory. To mitigate further backlog, I recommend aligning our orders closely with anticipated demand to avoid overstocking and optimize our supply chain responsiveness.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on collaborative order alignment to minimize backlog risks.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's implement a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure all parties are synchronized.
  Information Shared: I currently have a backlog of 31 units and have placed an order for 30 units to address expected demand.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I've been tracking demand, which remains steady around 11 units, but the fluctuations observed by the Distributor and Factory highlight the need for careful order alignment. We should all remain vigilant to avoid overstocking or backlogs. Let's collaborate on our upcoming orders based on this data.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on synchronized ordering based on recent demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a weekly update on our inventory and demand forecasts to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I've noticed steady demand averaging around 11 units, but fluctuations observed by the Distributor and Factory highlight the need for careful order alignment. Let's ensure we synchronize our orders to respond effectively and avoid stockouts or backlogs.
  Strategy Hint: Order strategically based on expected demand while maintaining a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a weekly update on our inventory and demand forecasts to align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 38 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me to fulfill upcoming orders effectively.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I've observed significant fluctuations in demand, with recent orders peaking at 42 units. Currently, I have a backlog of 12 units and no inventory, indicating the need for careful order coordination to prevent further backlog. It's crucial we align our strategies to mitigate risks associated with demand variability.
  Strategy Hint: Order quantities should reflect both current backlogs and anticipated demand to maintain balance.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to synchronize our supply chain efforts effectively.
  Information Shared: I currently have a backlog of 12 units and have placed an order for 20 units to meet anticipated demand.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [42]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit. Consider:
        
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 40, 42]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: Based on recent demand trends, I have observed fluctuations with orders reaching up to 42 units. Currently, I have a backlog of 12 units and no inventory, which indicates a need for careful coordination to prevent further backlog. I recommend we align our orders closely to the expected demand to mitigate risks.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to better synchronize our supply chain efforts.
- Factory: I've observed fluctuating demand with recent orders peaking at 70 units. Currently, I have a backlog of 31 units and no inventory. To mitigate further backlog, I recommend aligning our orders closely with anticipated demand to avoid overstocking and optimize our supply chain responsiveness.
  Proposal: Let's implement a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure all parties are synchronized.
- Retailer: I've been tracking demand, which remains steady around 11 units, but the fluctuations observed by the Distributor and Factory highlight the need for careful order alignment. We should all remain vigilant to avoid overstocking or backlogs. Let's collaborate on our upcoming orders based on this data.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a weekly update on our inventory and demand forecasts to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed steady demand averaging around 11 units, but fluctuations observed by the Distributor and Factory highlight the need for careful order alignment. Let's ensure we synchronize our orders to respond effectively and avoid stockouts or backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a weekly update on our inventory and demand forecasts to align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I've observed significant fluctuations in demand, with recent orders peaking at 42 units. Currently, I have a backlog of 12 units and no inventory, indicating the need for careful order coordination to prevent further backlog. It's crucial we align our strategies to mitigate risks associated with demand variability.
  Proposal: I propose a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to synchronize our supply chain efforts effectively.
- Factory: I've observed significant fluctuations in demand, with recent orders peaking at 70 units and an existing backlog of 31 units. To avoid further backlog and optimize our supply chain, I recommend aligning our orders closely with anticipated demand. Let's remain agile to respond to any sudden spikes in demand.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to synchronize our supply chain efforts effectively.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 31 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 70, 50]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (31 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: Based on recent demand trends, I have observed fluctuations with orders reaching up to 42 units. Currently, I have a backlog of 12 units and no inventory, which indicates a need for careful coordination to prevent further backlog. I recommend we align our orders closely to the expected demand to mitigate risks.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to better synchronize our supply chain efforts.
- Factory: I've observed fluctuating demand with recent orders peaking at 70 units. Currently, I have a backlog of 31 units and no inventory. To mitigate further backlog, I recommend aligning our orders closely with anticipated demand to avoid overstocking and optimize our supply chain responsiveness.
  Proposal: Let's implement a weekly update on our order quantities and demand forecasts to ensure all parties are synchronized.
- Retailer: I've been tracking demand, which remains steady around 11 units, but the fluctuations observed by the Distributor and Factory highlight the need for careful order alignment. We should all remain vigilant to avoid overstocking or backlogs. Let's collaborate on our upcoming orders based on this data.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a weekly update on our inventory and demand forecasts to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed steady demand averaging around 11 units, but fluctuations observed by the Distributor and Factory highlight the need for careful order alignment. Let's ensure we synchronize our orders to respond effectively and avoid stockouts or backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose we implement a weekly update on our inventory and demand forecasts to align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I've observed significant fluctuations in demand, with recent orders peaking at 42 units.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 63 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [77]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 42, 45]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 42
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 156 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 15, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've observed that demand has been fluctuating significantly, with recent orders averaging around 42 to 45 units. Our current backlog of 2 units highlights the urgency of addressing this demand. It's crucial that we coordinate our orders to mitigate the risk of overstock or further backlog.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly demand forecast meeting to align our orders and share our inventory levels more effectively.
- Factory: I've noticed a significant backlog of 131 units and recent demand trends showing fluctuations with a possibility of spikes. It is crucial for us to align our orders to manage this effectively.
  Proposal: I propose we share updated weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I've noted recent demand patterns fluctuating between 9 and 15 units, with a potential spike to 30. It's essential we monitor these trends closely to optimize our inventory levels and avoid stockouts or excess. Coordination will help us handle demand fluctuations effectively.
  Proposal: Let's agree on a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory updates to align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I've observed recent demand stabilizing around 12 units with a potential increase expected. Coordination will be essential to manage fluctuations effectively and maintain optimal inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I suggest we implement a regular schedule for sharing weekly demand forecasts and inventory updates to align our strategies and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I've observed significant fluctuations in recent demand, with orders averaging between 39 and 45 units. Currently, I have a backlog of 2 units, indicating that we must act swiftly to meet demand while avoiding excess inventory. Effective communication will be crucial to navigate these trends.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a bi-weekly meeting to share updated demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring we all align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noticed a significant backlog of 131 units and recent demand trends indicating potential spikes. Effective communication and coordination will be essential to navigate these fluctuations and minimize the bullwhip effect across our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing demand forecasts and inventory updates to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've noticed a significant backlog of 11 units and no inventory, indicating a shift in demand patterns. Recent orders have been high but are declining. Coordination on order quantities will be crucial to avoid further backlogs and excess inventory throughout the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's initiate a bi-weekly meeting to review demand data and adjust our orders collaboratively to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noticed a significant backlog of 55 units and zero inventory, indicating an urgent need to align our orders with the observed demand. Recent orders have fluctuated, and I anticipate a potential spike in demand. Coordination on order quantities will be crucial to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further backlogs.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a weekly meeting to share real-time demand data and adjust our orders to minimize fluctuations and avoid excess inventory.
- Retailer: I've noticed a significant decline in recent demand, with orders dropping to as low as 4 units. This trend highlights the importance of closely monitoring our inventory levels across the supply chain to avoid excess stock. Let's coordinate our order quantities to respond effectively to these fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly meeting to share our inventory and demand data, allowing us to align our order quantities more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I've observed a continued decline in recent demand, with orders averaging around 9 units and a significant drop to 4 units. It's crucial that we coordinate our orders effectively to avoid excess inventory and backlogs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I recommend establishing a weekly meeting to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, allowing us to adjust our orders collaboratively.
- Distributor: I've observed a significant backlog of 11 units and a concerning trend of declining demand, with recent orders averaging 39 units. To prevent further backlogs and potential excess inventory, we must coordinate our order quantities effectively. Let's remain vigilant and responsive to these changes.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a weekly sync-up to share demand data and adjust our orders collaboratively, minimizing the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've observed a significant backlog of 55 units and zero inventory, indicating a pressing need to align our orders with current demand patterns. Recent demands have been fluctuating, and I anticipate a possible spike. Coordination on order quantities is essential to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly meeting to share real-time demand data and adjust our orders collaboratively to minimize fluctuations and avoid excess inventory.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 117 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15, 9, 4]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 11 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [45, 39, 34]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [170]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 44
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (11 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've noticed a significant backlog of 11 units and no inventory, indicating a shift in demand patterns. Recent orders have been high but are declining. Coordination on order quantities will be crucial to avoid further backlogs and excess inventory throughout the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's initiate a bi-weekly meeting to review demand data and adjust our orders collaboratively to minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noticed a significant backlog of 55 units and zero inventory, indicating an urgent need to align our orders with the observed demand. Recent orders have fluctuated, and I anticipate a potential spike in demand. Coordination on order quantities will be crucial to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further backlogs.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a weekly meeting to share real-time demand data and adjust our orders to minimize fluctuations and avoid excess inventory.
- Retailer: I've noticed a significant decline in recent demand, with orders dropping to as low as 4 units. This trend highlights the importance of closely monitoring our inventory levels across the supply chain to avoid excess stock. Let's coordinate our order quantities to respond effectively to these fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly meeting to share our inventory and demand data, allowing us to align our order quantities more effectively.
- Wholesaler: I've observed a continued decline in recent demand, with orders averaging around 9 units and a significant drop to 4 units. It's crucial that we coordinate our orders effectively to avoid excess inventory and backlogs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I recommend establishing a weekly meeting to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, allowing us to adjust our orders collaboratively.
- Distributor: I've observed a significant backlog of 11 units and a concerning trend of declining demand, with recent orders averaging 39 units. To prevent further backlogs and potential excess inventory, we must coordinate our order quantities effectively. Let's remain vigilant and responsive to these changes.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a weekly sync-up to share demand data and adjust our orders collaboratively, minimizing the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've observed a significant backlog of 55 units and zero inventory, indicating a pressing need to align our orders with current demand patterns. Recent demands have been fluctuating, and I anticipate a possible spike. Coordination on order quantities is essential to stabilize our supply chain and prevent further backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly meeting to share real-time demand data and adjust our orders collaboratively to minimize fluctuations and avoid excess inventory.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 229 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 4, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [37]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 142 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 4, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've noticed that recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with orders ranging from 34 to 39 units. This variability suggests that we should be cautious in our ordering to avoid excess inventory and potential backlogs. Coordination on order quantities is crucial.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a bi-weekly meeting to share updated demand forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us adjust our orders collaboratively and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've observed significant demand fluctuations recently with orders peaking at 73 units. This suggests potential demand spikes that we should prepare for. It's crucial we coordinate our orders to avoid both overstocking and backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's establish weekly check-ins to share updated demand forecasts and inventory levels, ensuring our orders are aligned and minimizing the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I've observed significant fluctuations in recent demand with orders of 9, 4, and 7 units, indicating potential variability we need to manage. Coordination among all agents will be crucial to align our orders and avoid excess inventory or backlogs.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a weekly update cycle to share demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to adjust our orders collaboratively and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I've noticed fluctuations in recent demand, with orders of 9, 4, and 7 units. To mitigate potential excess inventory and backlogs, we should communicate regularly about our forecasts and orders. Coordination is key.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit. Consider:
        
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        
        Be strategic - share information that encourages good collaboration but maintains
        your competitive advantage. Keep messages concise but informative.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [62, 50, 73]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 117
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 8 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [34, 50, 170, 117]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I've observed a recent upward trend in demand with orders rising to 9 units. This indicates potential for increased demand in the upcoming rounds. It might be beneficial for us to coordinate on our order quantities to prevent overstock and stockouts throughout the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a safety stock while adjusting orders based on observed demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our forecasted demand and current inventory levels regularly, so we can adjust our orders collaboratively and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 254, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -242.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=I have ample inventory to meet estimated demand and avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate; high orders could lead to overstock., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=254, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[4, 7, 9], llm_incoming=[29], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 254 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 7, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit. Consider:
        
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        
        Be strategic - share information that encourages good collaboration but maintains
        your competitive advantage. Keep messages concise but informative.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 124 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [34, 37, 29]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 282 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [39]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit. Consider:
        
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 197 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [64]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've noticed a recent increase in demand with recent orders of 37, 29, and 39 units. To optimize our supply chain and mitigate the bullwhip effect, aligning our forecasts and inventory data is essential.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly inventory and demand forecast sharing routine to improve our collective response to market changes.
- Factory: I've noticed a significant backlog of 23 units in our current state, indicating that demand is higher than what we anticipated. It's crucial that we align our forecasts to respond effectively to this trend.
  Proposal: Let's implement a weekly schedule for sharing our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will help us synchronize our orders and avoid excess backlog.
- Retailer: I've observed consistent demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 8.33 units. To mitigate the bullwhip effect, I suggest we coordinate on demand forecasting and inventory sharing to better align our orders. Given my current inventory of 282 units, I am prepared to fulfill upcoming demand while minimizing backlog risks.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly communication routine to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will enhance our collective responsiveness to market changes.
- Wholesaler: I've observed stable demand patterns with recent orders averaging around 8.33 units. It's essential that we coordinate our forecasts to prevent overreacting to fluctuations. I encourage everyone to share inventory levels to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's implement a bi-weekly communication routine to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts for better alignment.
- Distributor: I've observed a recent increase in demand with orders reaching up to 39 units. To navigate this trend effectively and reduce the risk of backlog, I recommend we coordinate our forecasts and maintain open communication about inventory levels. This will help us align our order quantities better and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly communication routine to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, enhancing our collective response to market fluctuations.
- Factory: I've observed a significant backlog of 23 units, indicating demand is higher than anticipated. To address this, we should align our forecasts and order quantities to mitigate future backlogs and overstock situations. Coordination is essential as we move forward.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly communication routine to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, enhancing our collective responsiveness.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 23 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [73, 54, 64]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 60
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (23 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 303, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -450.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.8, rationale=Current inventory exceeds expected demand, ensuring no stockouts., risk_assessment=Fluctuations in demand could lead to overstock if not monitored., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=303, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 9, 8], llm_incoming=[38], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 303 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 279 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [29, 39, 38]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [60]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,

- Distributor: I've observed a fluctuation in demand with recent orders totaling 29, 39, and 38 units. Given my current inventory of 279 units and no backlog, I am adjusting my order strategy to align with expected demand. It's crucial that we all share our demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and minimize the risk of backlogs in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance visibility and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noted a significant backlog of 66 units, indicating a surge in demand that surpasses recent averages. It's vital for us to align our orders based on the latest demand patterns to prevent further backlogs and optimize inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly meeting to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, enhancing our visibility and coordination.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 66 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [54, 64, 63]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 77
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (66 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've observed recent demand fluctuations with orders of 29, 39, and 38 units. While my current inventory stands at 279 units with no backlog, I plan to adjust my order quantity to align with expected demand. Maintaining a collaborative approach can help us mitigate potential backlogs across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I suggest we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels, which can help us better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noticed a significant backlog of 66 units, indicating a spike in demand that may be beyond our recent averages. It's crucial for us to align our orders based on the latest demand patterns to prevent further backlogs and optimize our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts weekly, as this will help us coordinate our orders more effectively and reduce the risk of excess inventory or backlogs.
- Retailer: I've noticed consistent demand trends averaging around 8-9 units, which aligns with your observations. Given my current inventory of 303 units, I can meet this demand effectively. However, I recommend we closely monitor fluctuations to avoid potential overstock while ensuring we can respond swiftly to any sudden demand spikes.
  Proposal: Let's implement a bi-weekly meeting to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, enhancing our visibility and coordination across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I've observed stable demand around 8-9 units, and I currently hold 213 units in inventory with no backlog. To optimize our supply chain, I suggest we continue to collaborate closely and monitor demand fluctuations to prevent excess stock or shortages.
  Proposal: Let's implement a weekly check-in to align our inventory levels and demand forecasts, which will help us reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I've observed a fluctuation in demand with recent orders totaling 29, 39, and 38 units. Given my current inventory of 279 units and no backlog, I am adjusting my order strategy to align with expected demand. It's crucial that we all share our demand forecasts to optimize our inventory levels and minimize the risk of backlogs in the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance visibility and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noted a significant backlog of 66 units, indicating a surge in demand that surpasses recent averages. It's vital for us to align our orders based on the latest demand patterns to prevent further backlogs and optimize inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly meeting to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, enhancing our visibility and coordination.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit. Consider:
        
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        
        Be strategic - share information that encourages good collaboration but maintains
        your competitive advantage. Keep messages concise but informative.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          â€¢ Initial Inventory: 100 units
          â€¢ Initial Backlog: 0 units
          â€¢ Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          â€¢ Your current role's position in the supply chain
          â€¢ You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          â€¢ You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          â€¢ You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          â€¢ You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          â€¢ You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          â€¢ You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         â€¢ IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         â€¢ Never let the inventory go to zero.
