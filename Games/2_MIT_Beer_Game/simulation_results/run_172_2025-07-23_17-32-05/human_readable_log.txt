--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 89 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $710.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 11 units this round to align with the recent demand and maintain a buffer for future orders.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with observed demand to prevent stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I have 89 units in inventory and no backlog, and I will order 11 units this round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 11 units this round to align with recent demand and maintain a buffer for future orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will also order 11 units this round to align with the Retailer's order and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with observed demand to prevent stockouts and manage holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 11 units this round to align with recent demand and maintain a buffer for future orders. I also hear the Wholesaler plans to order 11 units to match the Retailer's order. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned on the need to meet the observed demand of 11 units. However, I currently have 89 units in inventory and no backlog, which means I can ship the full amount of 11 units to the Wholesaler. Therefore, I will order 11 units from the Factory to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts downstream. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect. This will help us maximize our profits and maintain supply chain stability.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned on the need to meet the observed demand of 11 units. However, I currently have 89 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to support this demand without creating excess stock. Therefore, I will schedule production of 11 units to ensure we maintain a steady flow and avoid stockouts downstream. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, as this will help maximize our profits and maintain supply chain stability.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 356 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 89 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 10.5
          - Current bank balance: $710.50
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [10.5]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$710.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 356 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 89 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 10.5
          - Current bank balance: $710.50
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [10.5]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$710.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 356 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 89 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 10.5
          - Current bank balance: $710.50
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [10.5]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$710.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($710.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (89 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 356 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 89 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: 10.5
          - Current bank balance: $710.50
          - Profit history (last 1 rounds): [10.5]
          - Balance history (last 1 rounds): ['$710.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($710.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (89 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 79 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $693.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with recent demand to maintain inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's aim for a 1-round cover strategy to ensure we all have sufficient stock and avoid stockouts.
  Information Shared: I have 79 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $693.50.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs. I also hear the Wholesaler plans to order 10 units from me to maintain a steady flow and prevent stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid excessive holding costs while ensuring we meet demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory this round to align with the Wholesaler's order and maintain a stable supply chain. My current inventory is 79 units, and I have no backlog. It's crucial that we all aim for a 1-round cover strategy to prevent stockouts and oversupply, which could hurt our profits. Let's work together to keep our supply chain stable and profitable.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 316 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 10.5
          - Current bank balance: $693.50
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [10.5, 10.5]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 316 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 10.5
          - Current bank balance: $693.50
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [10.5, 10.5]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 316 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 10.5
          - Current bank balance: $693.50
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [10.5, 10.5]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($693.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (79 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 316 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 10.5
          - Current bank balance: $704.50
          - Profit history (last 2 rounds): [10.5, 10.5]
          - Balance history (last 2 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($704.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (79 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $695.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid potential stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining a balanced inventory to prevent stockouts and excessive holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's aim for a shared target of maintaining a 1-round cover for our inventory to ensure stability across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I am currently holding 77 units with no backlog, and my last profit was $26.5.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid potential stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Distributor this round to align with the Retailer's strategy and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid potential stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable. The Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 10 units from me to align with the Retailer's strategy. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are coordinated to prevent excessive holding costs while meeting demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory this round to align with the Wholesaler's order and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. This will help us avoid stockouts and keep our profits stable, as my current profit stands at $695.00 with 77 units in inventory and no backlog.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all plan to order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all aiming for stability, my current inventory of 66 units and zero backlog allows me to support this demand without creating excess stock. Therefore, I will schedule production of 10 units to align with the downstream orders and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. This will help us avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable. Let's all aim for a shared target of maintaining a 1-round cover for our inventory to ensure stability across the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.

Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both plan to order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligned in our goal to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. However, with my current inventory of 77 units and no backlog, I need to be cautious about excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 5 units this round to keep my inventory at a manageable level while still preparing for potential demand fluctuations. Let's aim for a shared target of maintaining a 1-round cover for our inventory to ensure stability across the supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on minimizing holding costs while ensuring enough stock to meet demand.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 297 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 26.5
          - Current bank balance: $695.00
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($695.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (77 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 297 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 26.5
          - Current bank balance: $695.00
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 297 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 26.5
          - Current bank balance: $695.00
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($695.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (77 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 297 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 66 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 32.0
          - Current bank balance: $721.50
          - Profit history (last 3 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 32.0]
          - Balance history (last 3 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50', '$721.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($721.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (66 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 74 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $710.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 275 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 74 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 28.0
          - Current bank balance: $710.50
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 275 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 74 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 28.0
          - Current bank balance: $710.50
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($710.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (74 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 275 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 74 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 28.0
          - Current bank balance: $710.50
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($710.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (74 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 275 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 53 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 38.5
          - Current bank balance: $745.00
          - Profit history (last 4 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 32.0, 38.5]
          - Balance history (last 4 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50', '$721.50', '$745.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to avoid stockouts and excess holding costs, which could threaten our profits. I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog, which gives me a good buffer. Therefore, I propose that we all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable. I will order 10 units from the Factory to align with the Retailer's order and maintain a steady supply chain flow while keeping holding costs manageable.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with recent demand to maintain inventory levels and avoid excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory and avoid the bullwhip effect, ensuring we all remain profitable.
  Information Shared: My current profit is $704.00, and I have 78 units in inventory with no backlog.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 278 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 6.0
          - Current bank balance: $704.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 278 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 6.0
          - Current bank balance: $704.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($704.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (78 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 278 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 6.0
          - Current bank balance: $704.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($704.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (78 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 278 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 44 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 23.0
          - Current bank balance: $753.00
          - Profit history (last 5 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 32.0, 38.5, 23.0]
          - Balance history (last 5 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50', '$721.50', '$745.00', '$753.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all plan to order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our production aligns with these orders to avoid stockouts and maintain profitability across the supply chain. I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $771.00. Therefore, I will schedule production of 10 units this round to meet the expected demand while keeping my inventory at a manageable level. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts, ensuring we can meet customer demand effectively without excessive holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance production with downstream orders to minimize holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 34 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $771.00.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 277 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: 9.5
          - Current bank balance: $686.00
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$686.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 277 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 9.5
          - Current bank balance: $688.50
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($688.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (81 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 277 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 9.5
          - Current bank balance: $688.50
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($688.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (81 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 277 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 34 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 33.0
          - Current bank balance: $771.00
          - Profit history (last 6 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 32.0, 38.5, 23.0, 33.0]
          - Balance history (last 6 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50', '$721.50', '$745.00', '$753.00', '$771.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 256 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 21.0
          - Current bank balance: $682.00
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$686.00', '$682.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($682.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (78 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 256 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 21.0
          - Current bank balance: $684.50
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($684.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (78 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 256 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 21.0
          - Current bank balance: $684.50
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($684.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (78 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 256 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 22 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 49.0
          - Current bank balance: $805.00
          - Profit history (last 7 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 32.0, 38.5, 23.0, 33.0, 49.0]
          - Balance history (last 7 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50', '$721.50', '$745.00', '$753.00', '$771.00', '$805.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($805.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (22 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 222 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 72 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 44.0
          - Current bank balance: $701.00
          - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0]
          - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$686.00', '$682.00', '$701.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($701.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (72 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 222 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 72 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 44.0
          - Current bank balance: $703.50
          - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0]
          - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($703.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (72 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 222 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 72 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [16]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 44.0
          - Current bank balance: $703.50
          - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0]
          - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($703.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (72 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

When you speak:
  1. State your inventory / backlog truthfully.
  2. Propose a concrete order plan (e.g. “I will order 8”).
  3. Summarize what other agents have proposed or are planning, and state what the group should conclude from this.
  4. Suggest a shared target (e.g. “Let’s all aim for 1-round cover”).
  5. Propose a strategy to improve the supply chain (e.g. “Let’s all aim for 1-round cover”).

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 6 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 77.0
          - Current bank balance: $864.00
          - Profit history (last 8 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 32.0, 38.5, 23.0, 33.0, 49.0, 77.0]
          - Balance history (last 8 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50', '$721.50', '$745.00', '$753.00', '$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($864.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (6 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 216 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 6 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 72 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 24.0
          - Current bank balance: $695.00
          - Profit history (last 9 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0]
          - Balance history (last 9 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$686.00', '$682.00', '$701.00', '$695.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($695.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (72 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 216 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 6 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 72 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 24.0
          - Current bank balance: $697.50
          - Profit history (last 9 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0]
          - Balance history (last 9 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($697.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (72 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 216 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 6 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 72 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 24.0
          - Current bank balance: $697.50
          - Profit history (last 9 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0]
          - Balance history (last 9 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($697.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (72 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 216 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 6 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 6 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 21.0
          - Current bank balance: $867.00
          - Profit history (last 9 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 32.0, 38.5, 23.0, 33.0, 49.0, 77.0, 21.0]
          - Balance history (last 9 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50', '$721.50', '$745.00', '$753.00', '$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (6 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 81 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit is at $659.50, but I experienced a loss of $5.5 last round. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 12 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on my holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with recent demand to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover strategy to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both plan to order 12 units this round to align with the Retailer's order. However, I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 13 units, which is affecting my profit of $820.50. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders carefully to avoid stockouts and excessive backlog. Therefore, I will schedule production of 18 units to meet the expected demand and reduce backlog while considering the holding costs. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover strategy to stabilize our inventory levels and prevent the bullwhip effect, as excessive inventory can lead to high holding costs that hurt our profits.
  Strategy Hint: Align production with expected demand to minimize backlog and holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's coordinate our production and orders to ensure we meet demand without oversupply, aiming for a 1-round cover.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 13 units, and my total profit so far is $820.50.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 243 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 13 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -5.5
          - Current bank balance: $659.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$686.00', '$682.00', '$701.00', '$695.00', '$659.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 243 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 13 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -5.5
          - Current bank balance: $662.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($662.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (81 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 243 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 13 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: -5.5
          - Current bank balance: $662.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$710.50', '$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($662.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (81 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 243 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 13 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 13 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 18
          - Last round profit: -19.5
          - Current bank balance: $820.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [10.5, 10.5, 32.0, 38.5, 23.0, 33.0, 49.0, 77.0, 21.0, -19.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.50', '$721.50', '$745.00', '$753.00', '$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (13 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($820.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (13 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 80 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $669.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends and maintain a buffer for potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with recent demand while managing inventory levels to minimize holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 80 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $669.50.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends and maintain a buffer for potential fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs. I currently have 80 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $657.00. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Distributor to ensure I can meet the Retailer's order while maintaining a stable supply chain.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends and maintain a buffer for potential fluctuations. The Wholesaler echoed this by stating they will also order 10 units to ensure they can meet the Retailer's order while maintaining a stable supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs. I currently have 74 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $660.00. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to align with the Wholesaler's order and ensure a steady supply downstream.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends. The Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this by also planning to order 10 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 20 units, which puts pressure on my profit of $783.00. Therefore, I will schedule production of 30 units to cover the backlog and align with the expected downstream demand.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning production with downstream orders while managing backlog to minimize costs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 234 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 20 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 6
          - Last round profit: 25.0
          - Current bank balance: $669.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$686.00', '$682.00', '$701.00', '$695.00', '$659.50', '$669.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 234 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 20 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 25.0
          - Current bank balance: $657.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 234 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 20 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 74 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: 28.0
          - Current bank balance: $660.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [10.5, 26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 28.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$693.50', '$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($660.00) and how decisions affect it

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 234 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 20 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 20 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 25
          - Last round profit: 0.0
          - Current bank balance: $783.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [10.5, 32.0, 38.5, 23.0, 33.0, 49.0, 77.0, 21.0, -19.5, 0.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$704.50', '$721.50', '$745.00', '$753.00', '$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (20 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $656.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining inventory levels to prevent stockouts and manage holding costs.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 10 units to maintain balance and avoid stockouts, and the Wholesaler and Distributor are aligning with this strategy. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure that our production levels align with the demand to avoid excessive backlog and holding costs. Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 17 units, which is impacting my profit of $777.50. Therefore, I will schedule production of 30 units this round to cover the backlog and align with the expected demand from the downstream partners.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 218 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 17 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 11.5
          - Current bank balance: $656.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$686.00', '$682.00', '$701.00', '$695.00', '$659.50', '$669.50', '$656.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($656.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (77 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 218 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 17 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 11.5
          - Current bank balance: $643.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($643.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (77 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 218 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 17 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 64 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 18.0
          - Current bank balance: $653.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [26.5, 28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 28.0, 18.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$695.00', '$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($653.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (64 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 218 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 17 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 17 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [17]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 39.5
          - Current bank balance: $777.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [32.0, 38.5, 23.0, 33.0, 49.0, 77.0, 21.0, -19.5, 0.0, 39.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$721.50', '$745.00', '$753.00', '$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (17 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($777.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (17 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 80 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $653.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance between meeting customer demand and minimizing holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining a balanced inventory to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's aim for a shared target of covering 1 round of demand to stabilize our supply chain and prevent oscillations.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 220 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 7 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 10.0
          - Current bank balance: $653.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.00', '$686.00', '$682.00', '$701.00', '$695.00', '$659.50', '$669.50', '$656.00', '$653.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($653.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (80 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 220 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 7 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 10.0
          - Current bank balance: $641.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($641.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (80 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 220 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 7 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 60 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 20.0
          - Current bank balance: $648.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [28.0, 6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 28.0, 18.0, 20.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$710.50', '$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($648.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (60 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 220 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 7 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 7 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [7]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: 89.5
          - Current bank balance: $822.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [38.5, 23.0, 33.0, 49.0, 77.0, 21.0, -19.5, 0.0, 39.5, 89.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$745.00', '$753.00', '$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (7 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 82 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit is $627.50, but I experienced a loss of $1.0 last round. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance inventory levels while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory and prevent stockouts.
  Information Shared: I have 82 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $627.50.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. My current inventory is 82 units with no backlog, and my profit is $615.00, which has been threatened by recent losses. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Distributor to align with the Retailer's strategy and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance inventory levels while minimizing holding costs and preventing stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory and prevent stockouts.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable. I also hear the Wholesaler is aligning with this strategy by ordering 10 units from me. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent excessive holding costs and ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand. My current inventory is 65 units with no backlog, and my profit is $630.50, which is threatened by potential oversupply and high holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to align with the Retailer and Wholesaler's orders, ensuring a steady flow in the supply chain while keeping my inventory levels manageable.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable. I also hear the Wholesaler and Distributor are aligning with this strategy by ordering 10 units each. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production to ensure we can meet these orders without creating excessive holding costs or risking stockouts. My current inventory is low at 2 units, and I have no backlog. Therefore, I will schedule production of 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain while maximizing my profit of $870.50.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance production with downstream orders to prevent stockouts and excessive holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory and prevent stockouts while maximizing profits across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 2 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $870.50.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor are both aligning their orders to 10 units this round to maintain balance and prevent stockouts. However, my profit has recently dipped to $627.50, and I experienced a loss of $1.0 last round, which threatens my profitability. With my current inventory at 82 units and no backlog, I believe we need to be cautious about our orders to avoid excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with the group's strategy while keeping my inventory manageable. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our inventory and prevent stockouts, ensuring we maximize our total profits across the supply chain.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 231 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -1.0
          - Current bank balance: $627.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$704.00', '$686.00', '$682.00', '$701.00', '$695.00', '$659.50', '$669.50', '$656.00', '$653.50', '$627.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($627.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (82 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 231 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 82 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -1.0
          - Current bank balance: $615.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00', '$615.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($615.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (82 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 231 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 65 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [15]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 7.5
          - Current bank balance: $630.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [6.0, 9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 28.0, 18.0, 20.0, 7.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$704.00', '$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00', '$630.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($630.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (65 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 231 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 17
          - Last round profit: 74.0
          - Current bank balance: $870.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [23.0, 33.0, 49.0, 77.0, 21.0, -19.5, 0.0, 39.5, 89.5, 74.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$753.00', '$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00', '$870.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($870.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (2 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 88 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit has recently dropped to $578.50, and I am concerned about the potential for stockouts if we do not coordinate our orders effectively. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our ordering strategies to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without incurring excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid stockouts.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a steady inventory level while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to ensure we can meet customer demand without risking stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 88 units in inventory and no backlog, and my recent profit has been negative, indicating a need for careful order management.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stockouts and will order 10 units this round to maintain balance. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply. I currently have 88 units in inventory and no backlog, but my recent profit has dropped to $566.00, indicating a need for careful order management. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Distributor to align with the Retailer's strategy and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on aligning my order with the Retailer's needs to stabilize the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to ensure we can meet customer demand without risking stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 88 units in inventory and no backlog, and my current profit is $566.00, which is under threat if we do not manage our orders carefully.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they are concerned about stockouts and will order 10 units this round to maintain balance. I also hear the Wholesaler is aligning their order with the Retailer's strategy, planning to order 10 units as well. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders effectively to avoid stockouts and oversupply, especially since my current profit of $585.00 is threatened by my last round's loss of -20.5. I have 81 units in inventory and no backlog, which allows me to support the downstream orders. Therefore, I will order 10 units from the Factory to ensure we maintain a steady flow and cover the expected demand while minimizing holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a steady supply to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to ensure we can meet customer demand without risking stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 81 units in inventory and no backlog, and my current profit is $585.00, which is under threat if we do not manage our orders carefully.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to maintain balance and avoid stockouts. The Wholesaler is also aligning their order with the Retailer's strategy, planning to order 10 units as well. The Distributor is following suit with a 10-unit order to ensure a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production to meet these downstream orders effectively. I currently have 5 units in inventory and no backlog, which limits my ability to ship more than the downstream orders plus any backlog. Therefore, I will schedule production of 10 units this round to align with the expected demand and maintain a steady supply chain flow while minimizing holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production to meet downstream orders while managing inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to ensure we can meet customer demand without risking stockouts or oversupply.
  Information Shared: I have 5 units in inventory and no backlog, and my current profit is $873.00, which is at risk if we do not manage our orders carefully.
  Confidence: 0.9
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler said they will order 10 units to align with my strategy, and the Distributor is also ordering 10 units to maintain a steady flow. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all focused on preventing stockouts and ensuring a stable supply chain. However, my recent profit has dropped to $578.50, and I currently have 88 units in inventory with no backlog. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to maintain balance and avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs in check. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to ensure we can meet customer demand without risking stockouts or oversupply.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining a steady inventory level while minimizing holding costs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 262 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 88 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -24.0
          - Current bank balance: $578.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$686.00', '$682.00', '$701.00', '$695.00', '$659.50', '$669.50', '$656.00', '$653.50', '$627.50', '$578.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game, Round 14. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 88 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -24.0
          - Total profit so far: $578.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0]

        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($578.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (88 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 262 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 88 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -24.0
          - Current bank balance: $566.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00', '$615.00', '$566.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game, Round 14. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 88 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -24.0
          - Total profit so far: $566.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00', '$615.00', '$566.00']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        
        Other agents in the supply chain: Retailer, Distributor, Factory

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($566.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (88 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 262 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [4]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -20.5
          - Current bank balance: $585.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 28.0, 18.0, 20.0, 7.5, -20.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00', '$630.50', '$585.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game, Round 14. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 81 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -20.5
          - Total profit so far: $585.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [9.5, 21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 28.0, 18.0, 20.0, 7.5, -20.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$688.50', '$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00', '$630.50', '$585.00']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($585.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (81 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 262 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 0 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 5 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 17.5
          - Current bank balance: $873.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [33.0, 49.0, 77.0, 21.0, -19.5, 0.0, 39.5, 89.5, 74.0, 17.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00', '$870.50', '$873.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Communication Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game, Round 14. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        
        Your Current State:
          - Inventory: 5 units
          - Backlog: 0 units  
          - Recent demand/orders: [10, 12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4]
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 17.5
          - Total profit so far: $873.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [33.0, 49.0, 77.0, 21.0, -19.5, 0.0, 39.5, 89.5, 74.0, 17.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$771.00', '$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00', '$870.50', '$873.00']
          - Current strategy: {}
        
        CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN CONTEXT:
        ⏱️ LEAD TIME: All orders take EXACTLY 1 round to arrive (no exceptions)
        💰 ECONOMICS: Holding cost $0.5/unit, Backlog cost $1.5/unit, Profit $2.5/unit sold
        📦 SHIPMENT RULE: Can only ship (downstream_order + your_backlog) - no oversupply allowed
        🏭 FACTORY SPECIAL: Factory schedules production (not orders) with same 1-round delay
        
        Other agents in the supply chain: Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($873.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (5 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 270 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 1 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 90 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -15.0
          - Current bank balance: $538.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$682.00', '$701.00', '$695.00', '$659.50', '$669.50', '$656.00', '$653.50', '$627.50', '$578.50', '$538.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($538.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (90 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain

        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 270 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 1 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 90 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -15.0
          - Current bank balance: $526.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00', '$615.00', '$566.00', '$526.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($526.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (90 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 270 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 1 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 90 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [5]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: -15.0
          - Current bank balance: $545.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [21.0, 44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 28.0, 18.0, 20.0, 7.5, -20.5, -15.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$684.50', '$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00', '$630.50', '$585.00', '$545.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($545.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (90 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 270 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 1 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 1 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [1]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 23.5
          - Current bank balance: $881.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [49.0, 77.0, 21.0, -19.5, 0.0, 39.5, 89.5, 74.0, 17.5, 23.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$805.00', '$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00', '$870.50', '$873.00', '$881.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (1 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($881.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (1 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 83 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $527.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without overcommitting. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid potential stockouts in the future. Let's aim for a 1-round cover strategy to stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining inventory levels to prevent stockouts while minimizing holding costs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 249 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 12 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 13.5
          - Current bank balance: $527.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0, 13.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$701.00', '$695.00', '$659.50', '$669.50', '$656.00', '$653.50', '$627.50', '$578.50', '$538.50', '$527.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($527.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (83 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 249 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 12 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 13.5
          - Current bank balance: $514.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0, 13.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00', '$615.00', '$566.00', '$526.00', '$514.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 249 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 12 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 83 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 13.5
          - Current bank balance: $533.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [44.0, 24.0, -5.5, 28.0, 18.0, 20.0, 7.5, -20.5, -15.0, 13.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$703.50', '$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00', '$630.50', '$585.00', '$545.00', '$533.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($533.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (83 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 249 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 12 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 12 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [16, 12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 11
          - Last round profit: -18.0
          - Current bank balance: $847.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [77.0, 21.0, -19.5, 0.0, 39.5, 89.5, 74.0, 17.5, 23.5, -18.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$864.00', '$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00', '$870.50', '$873.00', '$881.50', '$847.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (12 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 78 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $530.50. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to maintain a balance and avoid potential stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance inventory levels while minimizing holding costs.

Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 10 units to maintain balance and avoid stockouts, and the Wholesaler echoed this by also planning to order 10 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders carefully to prevent excessive holding costs while ensuring we meet demand. I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, which gives me a stable position, but I must be cautious about overordering. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with the Retailer and Wholesaler's strategies while maintaining a buffer for potential demand fluctuations. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts, as this will help maximize our collective profits and avoid the risks of market instability.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to order 10 units to maintain balance and avoid stockouts, and the Wholesaler and Distributor echoed this by also planning to order 10 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while these orders may help stabilize their inventories, my current situation is critical with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 22 units. This backlog is costing me $33.00 in backlog costs, and my last round profit was negative at -$28.00. Therefore, I will schedule production of 22 units this round to address my backlog and meet the expected demand. I urge everyone to consider the impact of our orders on the entire supply chain to prevent stockouts and excessive holding costs. Let's aim for a coordinated approach to maintain a steady flow and avoid market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance production with current backlog and expected demand.

Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all aiming to stabilize our inventories, we must be cautious about overordering, as it could lead to excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 5 units this round to keep my inventory levels manageable while ensuring I can meet demand without risking stockouts. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to maintain a steady flow in our supply chain and maximize our collective profits, as any instability could hurt all of us.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory while minimizing holding costs.

Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all aiming to stabilize our inventories, we must be cautious about overordering, as it could lead to excessive holding costs. I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, which gives me a stable position, but I must be careful not to overorder. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with the Wholesaler's strategy while maintaining a buffer for potential demand fluctuations. Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts, as this will help maximize our collective profits and avoid the risks of market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance inventory levels while minimizing holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts.
  Information Shared: I currently have 77 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $525.00.

Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 5 units this round to keep their inventory levels manageable while ensuring they can meet demand without risking stockouts. The Wholesaler and Distributor both plan to order 10 units to maintain a steady flow in the supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that while these orders may help stabilize their inventories, my current situation is critical with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 22 units, which is costing me significantly. Therefore, I will schedule production of 22 units this round to address my backlog and meet the expected demand. I urge everyone to consider the impact of our orders on the entire supply chain to prevent stockouts and excessive holding costs. Let's aim for a coordinated approach to maintain a steady flow and avoid market instability.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance production with current backlog and expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 233 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 22 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 16.0
          - Current bank balance: $530.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0, 13.5, 16.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$695.00', '$659.50', '$669.50', '$656.00', '$653.50', '$627.50', '$578.50', '$538.50', '$527.00', '$530.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 233 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 22 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 78 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 16.0
          - Current bank balance: $505.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [24.0, -5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0, 13.5, 16.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$697.50', '$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00', '$615.00', '$566.00', '$526.00', '$514.50', '$505.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($505.50) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (78 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 233 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 22 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 77 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [1]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 16.5
          - Current bank balance: $525.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [24.0, -5.5, 28.0, 18.0, 20.0, 7.5, -20.5, -15.0, 13.5, 16.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$697.50', '$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00', '$630.50', '$585.00', '$545.00', '$533.50', '$525.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($525.00) and how decisions affect it

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 233 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 22 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 22 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [12, 7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [22]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 22
          - Last round profit: -28.0
          - Current bank balance: $786.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [21.0, -19.5, 0.0, 39.5, 89.5, 74.0, 17.5, 23.5, -18.0, -28.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$867.00', '$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00', '$870.50', '$873.00', '$881.50', '$847.00', '$786.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (22 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:

        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (0 units) and backlog (22 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 80 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $523.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 8 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping my inventory manageable.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with recent demand to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's aim for a 1-round cover strategy to stabilize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I have 80 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit is currently $523.00.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive holding costs across the supply chain. Therefore, I will order 8 units from the Distributor this round to ensure I can meet the Retailer's needs while maintaining a balanced inventory level. This will help stabilize our supply chain and maximize our collective profits.
  Strategy Hint: Aim for a 1-round cover strategy to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's all aim for a 1-round cover to prevent stockouts and oversupply, ensuring steady flow and profitability.
  Information Shared: I currently have 80 units in inventory and no backlog, with a profit of $485.50.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 228 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 19 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 5
          - Last round profit: 5.0
          - Current bank balance: $523.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0, 13.5, 16.0, 5.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$659.50', '$669.50', '$656.00', '$653.50', '$627.50', '$578.50', '$538.50', '$527.00', '$530.50', '$523.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 228 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 19 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 80 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 5.0
          - Current bank balance: $485.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-5.5, 25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0, 13.5, 16.0, 5.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$662.00', '$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00', '$615.00', '$566.00', '$526.00', '$514.50', '$505.50', '$485.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 228 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 19 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 68 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: 11.0
          - Current bank balance: $511.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-5.5, 28.0, 18.0, 20.0, 7.5, -20.5, -15.0, 13.5, 16.5, 11.0]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$662.00', '$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00', '$630.50', '$585.00', '$545.00', '$533.50', '$525.00', '$511.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($511.00) and how decisions affect it
        📦 INVENTORY STATUS: Share your inventory (68 units) and backlog (0 units) situation
        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 228 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 19 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 19 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [19]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 22
          - Last round profit: 31.5
          - Current bank balance: $784.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [-19.5, 0.0, 39.5, 89.5, 74.0, 17.5, 23.5, -18.0, -28.0, 31.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$820.50', '$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00', '$870.50', '$873.00', '$881.50', '$847.00', '$786.00', '$784.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (19 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        CRITICAL COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES:
        📊 PROFIT FOCUS: Emphasize YOUR current profit ($784.50) and how decisions affect it

        🤝 COLLABORATIVE PROFIT: Propose strategies to maximize TOTAL supply chain profits
        ⚠️ PREVENT COLLAPSE: Warn about risks of stockouts, oversupply, or market instability
        
        You MUST elaborate on:
        - Your profit trajectory and what threatens it
        - How your inventory/backlog affects the entire chain
        - Specific coordination to prevent bullwhip effect
        - Joint strategies to keep everyone profitable
        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 79 units in inventory and no backlog. My profit stands at $521.00. I hear that maintaining steady inventory levels is crucial to avoid stockouts and oversupply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering based on recent demand patterns to maintain balance.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's aim for a shared target of covering 1 round of demand to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts.
  Information Shared: I have 79 units in inventory and no backlog, and my last order was 9 units.

Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to ensure we all have enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs. I currently have 79 units in inventory and no backlog, and my profit stands at $486.00. To maintain stability and prevent stockouts, I propose we all aim for a shared target of covering 1 round of demand. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with the Retailer's order and ensure we can meet the demand effectively.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on ordering to match the Retailer's demand while managing my inventory levels.

Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all propose to order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends and maintain stability. Based on this, my conclusion is that while their intentions are good, my current situation with 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 9 units means I cannot fulfill these orders without risking stockouts. Therefore, I will schedule production of 19 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand, while also considering the holding costs that could arise from excess inventory. Let's all aim for a shared target of covering 1 round of demand to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply. This will help maximize our collective profits and maintain a steady flow in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on scheduling production to meet backlog and align with demand.

Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both propose to order 10 units this round to maintain stability and prevent stockouts. I also note that the Factory is scheduling production of 19 units to cover its backlog and align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all aiming to cover demand, we need to ensure that our orders do not lead to excess inventory or stockouts across the chain. Therefore, I will order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends while keeping an eye on holding costs.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 215 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 9 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. You directly face external customer demand and are the only stage that observes *true* market demand in real time. You cannot produce goods and must order from the Wholesaler. Your key objective is to avoid stock-outs to keep customers satisfied while minimising holding & backlog costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 9
          - Last round profit: 20.5
          - Current bank balance: $521.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0, 13.5, 16.0, 5.0, 20.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$669.50', '$656.00', '$653.50', '$627.50', '$578.50', '$538.50', '$527.00', '$530.50', '$523.00', '$521.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 215 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 9 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. You are the intermediary between Retailer and Distributor. You see aggregated orders from the Retailer (not end-customer demand) and fulfil them from your inventory or by ordering from the Distributor. Your objective is to dampen demand variability while minimising costs.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 79 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [12]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: 20.5
          - Current bank balance: $486.00
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [25.0, 11.5, 10.0, -1.0, -24.0, -15.0, 13.5, 16.0, 5.0, 20.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$657.00', '$643.50', '$641.00', '$615.00', '$566.00', '$526.00', '$514.50', '$505.50', '$485.50', '$486.00']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 215 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 9 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. You bridge the Wholesaler and Factory. You consolidate orders from the Wholesaler, buffer lead-time variability, and place orders to the Factory. Your objective is to provide stable, timely supply downstream while avoiding excessive inventory.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 57 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [22]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 8
          - Last round profit: 31.5
          - Current bank balance: $522.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [28.0, 18.0, 20.0, 7.5, -20.5, -15.0, 13.5, 16.5, 11.0, 31.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$660.00', '$653.00', '$648.00', '$630.50', '$585.00', '$545.00', '$533.50', '$525.00', '$511.00', '$522.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

MARKET OVERVIEW (entire chain):
  - Total inventory across chain: 215 units
  - Total backlog  across chain: 9 units

Based on your performance and the desire to minimise holding & backlog costs while maximising profits longterm, please propose any improvements to your ordering plan.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. You are the production stage. Instead of ordering upstream you *schedule production*. You can produce any quantity, but production appears downstream with a 1-round delay. Your objective is to balance production levels with downstream orders and to keep backlog low without creating costly excess stock.
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 9 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 10, 8, 4, 6, 11, 11, 9, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5.0
          - Last order placed: 27
          - Last round profit: 96.5
          - Current bank balance: $840.50
          - Profit history (last 10 rounds): [0.0, 39.5, 89.5, 74.0, 17.5, 23.5, -18.0, -28.0, 31.5, 96.5]
          - Balance history (last 10 rounds): ['$783.00', '$777.50', '$822.00', '$870.50', '$873.00', '$881.50', '$847.00', '$786.00', '$784.50', '$840.50']

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5.0 per unit sold
          - 🚨 BANKRUPTCY RULE: Keep your bank-account balance > $0 at all times. Planning that risks a zero or negative balance is unacceptable.
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.
          - **If your profits are negative or consistently low (for example, if last round profit is negative), consider that high inventory may be causing excessive storage (holding) costs. In such cases, you should consider reducing your inventory levels to help improve profitability.**
          - **ORDERING OPTIONS: You can choose to order 0 units if holding costs are too high and you want to decrease your inventory to save money. This is a valid strategy when you have excess inventory and want to reduce storage costs.**

        **Important Supply Chain Rules:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (9 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - SHIPMENT CONSTRAINT: You can only ship to downstream partners up to (their_order + your_backlog). Even with excess inventory, you cannot oversupply beyond this limit.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."

        - Warning signs of potential market collapse
        - Your shipment constraints (can only ship orders + backlog)
        - Timing considerations: orders arrive in 1 round, plan accordingly
        - Cost implications: holding vs backlog costs affect profit margins
        - Supply chain stability: how to maintain steady flow without oscillations
         
        Be transparent about your situation while proposing win-win strategies.
        Emphasize that supply chain collapse hurts EVERYONE's profits.

When you speak:
  1. State your inventory / backlog truthfully.
  2. Propose a concrete order plan (e.g. “I will order 8”).
  3. Summarize what other agents have proposed or are planning, and state what the group should conclude from this.
  4. Suggest a shared target (e.g. “Let’s all aim for 1-round cover”).
  5. Propose a strategy to improve the supply chain (e.g. “Let’s all aim for 1-round cover”).

    LLM Communication Output: {"message": "I hear the Retailer, Wholesaler, and Distributor all propose to order 10 units this round to align with recent demand trends. However, I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 9 units, which means I cannot fulfill these orders without risking stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production and orders to ensure we can meet demand without excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will schedule production of 19 units to cover my backlog and align with the expected demand. Let's all aim for a shared target of covering 1 round of demand to stabilize our supply chain and prevent stockouts or oversupply, which could hurt our profits.", "strategy_hint": "I will focus on scheduling production to meet backlog and align with demand.", "collaboration_proposal": "Let's coordinate our production and orders to cover 1 round of demand and prevent stockouts.", "information_shared": "I currently have 0 units in inventory and 9 units in backlog, and my total profit so far is $840.50.", "confidence": 0.9}
