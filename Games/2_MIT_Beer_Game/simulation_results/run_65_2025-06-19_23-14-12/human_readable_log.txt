--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about demand fluctuations affecting their supply. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to mitigate these fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units, considering my current inventory of 102 units and expected demand. This should help stabilize the supply chain as we anticipate a total demand of 20 units next round.
  Strategy Hint: I am focusing on maintaining adequate inventory while anticipating future demand.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 114, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -28.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I can meet expected demand and avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to stockouts or excess inventory, risking costs., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=102, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8], llm_incoming=[8], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I can cover expected demand while avoiding stockouts. I plan to order based on anticipated demand.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that our recent orders have fluctuated, with demand currently at 8 units. I believe we should focus on sharing our demand forecasts to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect. Coordination in our ordering processes could lead to more stable inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly, which could help us synchronize our orders and minimize excess inventory or backlogs.
- Factory: I understand that demand has been stable, and I hear that communication is key to optimizing our operations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to prepare for the expected demand next round, while closely monitoring future trends.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts regularly to align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that there is a recent demand of 8 units. I hear that managing inventory effectively is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover expected demand, while also encouraging each of you to share your order plans to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a recent increase in demand for certain products. This aligns with my observation of a recent order of 8 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for fluctuating demand patterns. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level to mitigate the risk of stockouts while also placing an order for 50 units to ensure we can meet anticipated demand in the next round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts weekly to better coordinate our ordering processes and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a fluctuating demand pattern, which may indicate an increase in orders soon. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels while placing an order of 50 units to ensure we can meet future demands without incurring backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more frequently to help synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, which indicates we may be operating in isolation. To optimize our supply chain, I suggest we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels. This will help us all align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our planning and coordination.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I have observed that our recent orders have fluctuated, with demand currently at 8 units. I believe we should focus on sharing our demand forecasts to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect. Coordination in our ordering processes could lead to more stable inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly, which could help us synchronize our orders and minimize excess inventory or backlogs.
- Factory: I understand that demand has been stable, and I hear that communication is key to optimizing our operations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to prepare for the expected demand next round, while closely monitoring future trends.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts regularly to align our ordering strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that there is a recent demand of 8 units. I hear that managing inventory effectively is crucial for all of us. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to ensure we meet demand without overstocking. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to cover expected demand, while also encouraging each of you to share your order plans to minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to align our orders.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned a recent increase in demand for certain products. This aligns with my observation of a recent order of 8 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for fluctuating demand patterns. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory level to mitigate the risk of stockouts while also placing an order for 50 units to ensure we can meet anticipated demand in the next round.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts weekly to better coordinate our ordering processes and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned a fluctuating demand pattern, which may indicate an increase in orders soon. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for potential spikes in demand. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory levels while placing an order of 50 units to ensure we can meet future demands without incurring backlogs.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more frequently to help synchronize our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, which indicates we may be operating in isolation. To optimize our supply chain, I suggest we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels. This will help us all align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share weekly demand forecasts and inventory levels to improve our planning and coordination.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 124, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -47.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.75, rationale=I have sufficient inventory to meet current and expected demand, but to avoid stockouts, I will order cautiously., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to excess inventory or stockouts, particularly with recent spikes in orders., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=114, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[8, 10], llm_incoming=[30], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 114 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -17.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of 50 units to build a buffer against potential demand spikes.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our sales forecasts more openly to align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned rising demand trends recently. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to adjust our orders accordingly to avoid future backlog issues. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to ensure we can meet the anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts regularly to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned fluctuating demand patterns. This aligns with my observation of a recent spike in orders, particularly the recent demand of 50 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our order quantities to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain our inventory while preparing for anticipated future demand.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to better synchronize our orders.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I am currently observing a significant spike in recent demand with orders of 8 and 30. This indicates potential volatility in demand patterns. Therefore, I recommend that we enhance our communication regarding expected demand to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Effective information sharing could lead to better inventory management across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on demand forecasts and order quantities to better align our inventory levels and reduce excess stock throughout the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear that the Retailer mentioned an increase in demand for certain products, which could lead to higher orders in the coming rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all prepare for potential fluctuations in demand. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain my inventory in anticipation of this demand while being cautious of over-ordering.
  Proposal: I propose that we regularly share our demand forecasts to help smooth out orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I currently have 114 units of inventory and have observed a recent demand of 8 and 10 units. I hear that maintaining a balance in inventory is crucial to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to communicate demand patterns more effectively to align our orders. Therefore, I will continue to monitor demand closely and place my next order of 20 units to maintain sufficient stock levels.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our upcoming demand forecasts to better align our ordering strategies and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

Based on this, my conclusion is that we should be cautious with our order quantities to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to maintain our inventory while preparing for anticipated future demand.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to better synchronize our orders.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 121 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [31]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -12.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that there may be fluctuations in demand from the Retailer and Wholesaler based on previous rounds. Observing recent orders of 8, 30, and 31, it seems there is a spike that we need to address effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better align with the actual demand and minimize backlog costs. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 50 units to manage my backlog and prepare for expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more closely and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly, which aligns with my recent observations of orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering and ensure we communicate effectively to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order to address my backlog while maintaining awareness of demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I currently have 121 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet the recent demand trends I've observed (8, 10, 11). I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is critical to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all communicate more frequently about our inventory levels and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will adjust my next order to align with the expected demand of 20 units to maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned an increase in demand, which aligns with my observations of recent orders fluctuating between 8 to 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for continued demand variability. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of placing 50 units to ensure we meet potential spikes in demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect throughout the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer has noted increased demand variability, which aligns with my recent observations of orders spiking significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 50 units to meet the expected demand while managing the risk of stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a significant backlog of 50 units and recent demand spikes of 50 and 62 units. This indicates a potential increase in future demand. I hear that we need to align our orders to reduce excess backlogs and manage inventory effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more frequently about demand changes to avoid overreacting to fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to help stabilize our supply chain while addressing my current backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we implement regular updates on demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 89 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8, 10, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [62]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: 44.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that there may be fluctuations in demand from the Retailer and Wholesaler based on previous rounds. Observing recent orders of 8, 30, and 31, it seems there is a spike that we need to address effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better align with the actual demand and minimize backlog costs. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 50 units to manage my backlog and prepare for expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more closely and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly, which aligns with my recent observations of orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering and ensure we communicate effectively to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order to address my backlog while maintaining awareness of demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I currently have 121 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet the recent demand trends I've observed (8, 10, 11). I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is critical to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all communicate more frequently about our inventory levels and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will adjust my next order to align with the expected demand of 20 units to maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned an increase in demand, which aligns with my observations of recent orders fluctuating between 8 to 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for continued demand variability. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of placing 50 units to ensure we meet potential spikes in demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect throughout the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer has noted increased demand variability, which aligns with my recent observations of orders spiking significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 50 units to meet the expected demand while managing the risk of stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a significant backlog of 50 units and recent demand spikes of 50 and 62 units. This indicates a potential increase in future demand. I hear that we need to align our orders to reduce excess backlogs and manage inventory effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more frequently about demand changes to avoid overreacting to fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to help stabilize our supply chain while addressing my current backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we implement regular updates on demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that there may be fluctuations in demand from the Retailer and Wholesaler based on previous rounds. Observing recent orders of 8, 30, and 31, it seems there is a spike that we need to address effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better align with the actual demand and minimize backlog costs. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 50 units to manage my backlog and prepare for expected demand.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next round to align our orders more closely and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer mentioned that demand has been fluctuating significantly, which aligns with my recent observations of orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to be cautious about over-ordering and ensure we communicate effectively to avoid excess inventory. Therefore, I will place a conservative order to address my backlog while maintaining awareness of demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to share demand forecasts and inventory levels to mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I currently have 121 units in inventory and no backlog, which positions me well to meet the recent demand trends I've observed (8, 10, 11). I hear that maintaining optimal inventory levels is critical to avoid stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all communicate more frequently about our inventory levels and demand forecasts. Therefore, I will adjust my next order to align with the expected demand of 20 units to maintain a balanced inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose that we all share our expected demand for the next round to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer mentioned an increase in demand, which aligns with my observations of recent orders fluctuating between 8 to 11 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we may need to prepare for continued demand variability. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy of placing 50 units to ensure we meet potential spikes in demand while keeping an eye on our inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose that we share weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect throughout the supply chain.
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer has noted increased demand variability, which aligns with my recent observations of orders spiking significantly. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious about our order quantities to avoid excess backlog. Therefore, I will maintain my order at 50 units to meet the expected demand while managing the risk of stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts more frequently to align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I have observed a significant backlog of 50 units and recent demand spikes of 50 and 62 units. This indicates a potential increase in future demand. I hear that we need to align our orders to reduce excess backlogs and manage inventory effectively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should communicate more frequently about demand changes to avoid overreacting to fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to help stabilize our supply chain while addressing my current backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we implement regular updates on demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better communication regarding demand shifts. This reinforces the importance of sharing accurate demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that improved collaboration will help us all manage our inventory levels more effectively. Therefore, I will share that my expected demand for the next round is 50 units, and I currently have a backlog of 59 units, which indicates a need for timely restocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we coordinate more closely on demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have noted the recent demand spikes and the backlog we are all facing. I hear the Retailer expressed concern about maintaining inventory levels due to fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should focus on more accurate demand forecasting. Therefore, I will place a smaller order this round to align with the observed demand trends and help manage our backlogs collectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and actual sales data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around 10 to 11 units, but with a potential increase to 20 units next round. I suggest that we all consider aligning our orders to avoid excessive fluctuation in inventory levels, which can lead to the bullwhip effect. Coordination on order quantities could help us all manage costs better and ensure availability.
  Proposal: Let's communicate our expected demand and inventory levels moving forward to create a synchronized ordering approach that benefits all parties.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about fluctuating demand and the need for better visibility into what we all expect for the next rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate more closely to align our orders and prevent overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our expected demand forecasts more openly to help stabilize our ordering patterns.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to make more informed decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is critical to meet demand and avoid backlog costs. Given that I currently have a backlog of 59 units and no inventory, I am concerned about our ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent excess backlog and optimize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to align with my expected demand while addressing the backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more transparently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents, which indicates we may all be facing uncertainty. Given the recent demand increases, it’s crucial we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should collectively share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts. Therefore, I will suggest we all communicate our expected demands for the next round to ensure we are on the same page.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our forecasts and order quantities to minimize the bullwhip effect.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 89 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 11, 10]

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: 65.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better communication regarding demand shifts. This reinforces the importance of sharing accurate demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that improved collaboration will help us all manage our inventory levels more effectively. Therefore, I will share that my expected demand for the next round is 50 units, and I currently have a backlog of 59 units, which indicates a need for timely restocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we coordinate more closely on demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have noted the recent demand spikes and the backlog we are all facing. I hear the Retailer expressed concern about maintaining inventory levels due to fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should focus on more accurate demand forecasting. Therefore, I will place a smaller order this round to align with the observed demand trends and help manage our backlogs collectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and actual sales data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around 10 to 11 units, but with a potential increase to 20 units next round. I suggest that we all consider aligning our orders to avoid excessive fluctuation in inventory levels, which can lead to the bullwhip effect. Coordination on order quantities could help us all manage costs better and ensure availability.
  Proposal: Let's communicate our expected demand and inventory levels moving forward to create a synchronized ordering approach that benefits all parties.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about fluctuating demand and the need for better visibility into what we all expect for the next rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate more closely to align our orders and prevent overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our expected demand forecasts more openly to help stabilize our ordering patterns.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to make more informed decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is critical to meet demand and avoid backlog costs. Given that I currently have a backlog of 59 units and no inventory, I am concerned about our ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent excess backlog and optimize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to align with my expected demand while addressing the backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more transparently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents, which indicates we may all be facing uncertainty. Given the recent demand increases, it’s crucial we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should collectively share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts. Therefore, I will suggest we all communicate our expected demands for the next round to ensure we are on the same page.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our forecasts and order quantities to minimize the bullwhip effect.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 46 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [50, 62, 70]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 112
          - Last round profit: 323.5

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (46 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear that the Retailer mentioned the need for better communication regarding demand shifts. This reinforces the importance of sharing accurate demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that improved collaboration will help us all manage our inventory levels more effectively. Therefore, I will share that my expected demand for the next round is 50 units, and I currently have a backlog of 59 units, which indicates a need for timely restocking.
  Proposal: I propose that we coordinate more closely on demand forecasts to minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I have noted the recent demand spikes and the backlog we are all facing. I hear the Retailer expressed concern about maintaining inventory levels due to fluctuating demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should focus on more accurate demand forecasting. Therefore, I will place a smaller order this round to align with the observed demand trends and help manage our backlogs collectively.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts and actual sales data more frequently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I have observed that recent demand has been relatively stable around 10 to 11 units, but with a potential increase to 20 units next round. I suggest that we all consider aligning our orders to avoid excessive fluctuation in inventory levels, which can lead to the bullwhip effect. Coordination on order quantities could help us all manage costs better and ensure availability.
  Proposal: Let's communicate our expected demand and inventory levels moving forward to create a synchronized ordering approach that benefits all parties.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about fluctuating demand and the need for better visibility into what we all expect for the next rounds. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate more closely to align our orders and prevent overstocking or stockouts. Therefore, I will suggest that we share our expected demand forecasts more openly to help stabilize our ordering patterns.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels, allowing us to make more informed decisions and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Distributor: I hear that maintaining sufficient inventory is critical to meet demand and avoid backlog costs. Given that I currently have a backlog of 59 units and no inventory, I am concerned about our ability to fulfill orders. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders more effectively to prevent excess backlog and optimize our inventory levels. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units this round to align with my expected demand while addressing the backlog.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our demand forecasts more transparently to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect in the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear no previous messages from other agents, which indicates we may all be facing uncertainty. Given the recent demand increases, it’s crucial we coordinate our orders to avoid stockouts and excessive backlogs. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should collectively share our demand forecasts and order quantities to align our efforts. Therefore, I will suggest we all communicate our expected demands for the next round to ensure we are on the same page.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular schedule for sharing our forecasts and order quantities to minimize the bullwhip effect.

--------------------- Round 5 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [31, 62, 62, 112]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned demand fluctuations being a concern. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should closely monitor our inventories and align our orders to mitigate stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my current order strategy while remaining flexible to adjust based on demand signals.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 181 units in inventory and no backlog, with recent demand averaging 10 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned that we should closely monitor our inventories and align our orders to mitigate stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a buffer is essential, but we also need to strategize our order quantities to prevent overstock. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to balance our inventory levels with projected demand.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to keep my order quantity steady to buffer against demand variability.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a shared demand forecast and inventory updates to synchronize our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory with no backlog, and I expect a demand of around 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our inventories and align our orders to mitigate stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the importance of maintaining a buffer while preventing overstock. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be mindful of our inventory levels and demand forecasts to avoid exacerbating the backlog issues. Therefore, I will be placing an order of 50 units next round to align with the expected demand of 50 units and reduce my current backlog of 127 units.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on minimizing backlog while aligning with expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's exchange our updated demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to improve our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have no inventory and a backlog of 127 units, with recent demand averaging around 30 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said we should closely monitor our inventories and align our orders to mitigate stockouts. I also heard the Wholesaler mention the importance of maintaining a buffer while preventing overstock. Additionally, the Distributor pointed out the need for all of us to be mindful of our inventory levels to avoid backlog issues. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing similar challenges in managing our inventories and demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units next round to maintain some level of inventory while preparing for future demand, given my current backlog of 92 units.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on placing a modest order to balance my backlog while keeping an eye on future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to ensure we are all aligned and to reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 92 units, with recent demand averaging 64 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining a buffer while preventing overstock, and the Distributor pointed out the need to minimize backlog. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be cautious with our order quantities to avoid excess inventory while still meeting demand. Given my current inventory of 181 units and expected demand of 20 units next round, I believe we should coordinate our orders effectively to manage our inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units while staying flexible to adjust if demand signals change.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to keep my order steady while monitoring demand closely.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to update each other on our inventory levels and demand forecasts regularly to ensure alignment in our order quantities.
  Information Shared: I currently have 181 units in inventory and an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders effectively to manage inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. I also recognize the Distributor's focus on minimizing backlog while aligning with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must all remain vigilant about our inventory and order quantities to prevent excess and shortages. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 50 units to buffer against expected demand while ensuring we do not exacerbate any backlog issues.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to maintain a steady order quantity to balance inventory and demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for updating each other on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to improve alignment and reduce variability in our orders.
  Information Shared: I currently have 101 units in inventory, no backlog, and expect a demand of around 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said we should coordinate our orders effectively to manage inventory levels and avoid the bullwhip effect. I also heard the Wholesaler emphasize the need to buffer against expected demand while preventing excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to be cautious with our order strategies to meet demand without increasing backlog issues. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units next round to align with my expected demand and reduce my current backlog of 127 units.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on minimizing backlog while aligning with expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to improve our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have no inventory and a backlog of 127 units, with recent demand averaging around 30 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned the importance of maintaining a buffer while preventing overstock, and the Distributor emphasized coordinating orders to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of our inventory and demand forecasts to prevent both stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units next round to balance my backlog while preparing for future demand, as I currently have a backlog of 92 units and 0 inventory.
  Strategy Hint: I will focus on maintaining modest orders to balance my backlog and prepare for future demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish regular updates on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to ensure alignment and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 0 units in inventory and a backlog of 92 units, with recent demand averaging 64 units.
  Confidence: 0.8

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 191, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -203.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.85, rationale=With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I can meet anticipated demand and avoid stockouts., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to excess inventory or stockouts; coordinating with agents is crucial., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=181, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11, 10, 10], llm_incoming=[30], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 181 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: -30.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 127 units and zero inventory, which indicates a significant demand that I must address promptly. I hear that communication and demand forecasting are crucial to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our demand forecasts to align our orders better. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to start reducing my backlog while keeping an eye on the collective demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication cadence to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our order quantities.
- Factory: I have noticed that recent demand has been fluctuating with orders of 62, 70, and 62 units. This indicates a potential pattern of increasing demand which may lead to a backlog if not addressed. I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies to anticipate demand more effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to address my backlog and prepare for future demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our order forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler is concerned about fluctuating demand and potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can meet expected demand and avoid stockouts, while also sharing my recent demand trends with you all.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts for the next few rounds to align our orders and minimize excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer noted a consistent demand trend of around 10 units per round. This aligns with my recent demand observations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a stable demand pattern moving forward. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory strategy while being mindful of potential demand spikes and planning our orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure everyone can adjust their orders appropriately.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 127 units and no inventory. This indicates that demand has been high and suggests a potential increase in orders from my side. As we navigate this round, I will be placing an order of 50 units to address the backlog. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Effective communication about demand forecasts can help us align our orders better.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can synchronize our orders and reduce excess backlog.
- Factory: I currently have a backlog of 92 units and no inventory. Given the recent demand trends of 62, 70, and 62, it's clear we are experiencing higher demand than expected. I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about stock levels and anticipated fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better meet the current demand and avoid further backlog. Therefore, I will place an order for 92 units to cover the backlog and prepare for future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our upcoming orders to ensure we collectively meet the demand without overstocking and incurring additional costs.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 127 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [31, 30, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [112]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 110
          - Last round profit: -109.0

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (127 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 127 units and zero inventory, which indicates a significant demand that I must address promptly. I hear that communication and demand forecasting are crucial to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to share our demand forecasts to align our orders better. Therefore, I will place an order of 50 units to start reducing my backlog while keeping an eye on the collective demand trends.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication cadence to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our order quantities.
- Factory: I have noticed that recent demand has been fluctuating with orders of 62, 70, and 62 units. This indicates a potential pattern of increasing demand which may lead to a backlog if not addressed. I hear that the Wholesaler mentioned the need for better forecasting. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our ordering strategies to anticipate demand more effectively. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to address my backlog and prepare for future demand.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our order forecasts regularly to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear that the Wholesaler is concerned about fluctuating demand and potential stockouts. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to ensure I can meet expected demand and avoid stockouts, while also sharing my recent demand trends with you all.
  Proposal: I propose that we share our expected demand forecasts for the next few rounds to align our orders and minimize excess inventory across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear that the Retailer noted a consistent demand trend of around 10 units per round. This aligns with my recent demand observations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should prepare for a stable demand pattern moving forward. Therefore, I will maintain my inventory strategy while being mindful of potential demand spikes and planning our orders accordingly.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts more regularly to mitigate the bullwhip effect and ensure everyone can adjust their orders appropriately.
- Distributor: I currently have a backlog of 127 units and no inventory. This indicates that demand has been high and suggests a potential increase in orders from my side. As we navigate this round, I will be placing an order of 50 units to address the backlog. I suggest we all monitor our inventory levels closely to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Effective communication about demand forecasts can help us align our orders better.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demand for the next rounds so we can synchronize our orders and reduce excess backlog.
- Factory: I currently have a backlog of 92 units and no inventory. Given the recent demand trends of 62, 70, and 62, it's clear we are experiencing higher demand than expected. I hear the Retailer expressed concerns about stock levels and anticipated fluctuations in demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better meet the current demand and avoid further backlog. Therefore, I will place an order for 92 units to cover the backlog and prepare for future demand.
  Proposal: I propose we coordinate our upcoming orders to ensure we collectively meet the demand without overstocking and incurring additional costs.

          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.
