Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 104, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 6, Profit: 30.00, Total Profit: -22.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=Ordering 20 units to maintain inventory and meet expected demand., risk_assessment=Risk of overstock if demand fluctuates significantly., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=104, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[6], llm_incoming=[6], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the need for better alignment and coordination. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to maintain my buffer against potential demand increases while ensuring we minimize the bullwhip effect through regular updates.
  Proposal: Let's establish a schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to optimize our orders across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will place an order for 20 units to maintain inventory while preparing for the anticipated demand increase, and Wholesaler emphasized the importance of our collaboration on demand forecasts. Based on this, my conclusion is that coordination among us is crucial to effectively manage inventory levels and mitigate potential risks from demand fluctuations. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units to align with the expected demand while maintaining a buffer against variability.
  Proposal: Let's continue to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to optimize our orders and reduce excess stock across the supply chain.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [6]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared
        
        Be strategic - acknowledge what others have said, share helpful information that 
        encourages good collaboration, but maintain your competitive advantage. Keep messages 
        concise but informative.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 104 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

--------------------- Round 2 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 12
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: As the Retailer, I have observed that our recent demand has fluctuated with orders of 6 and 12 units. I hear the Wholesaler expressed concerns about inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our orders to avoid overstock and stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units to ensure we meet anticipated demand without causing excess inventory downstream.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to keep a balanced inventory while closely monitoring demand trends.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our weekly demand forecasts to align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 102 units in inventory and no backlog. My expected demand for the next round is 20 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they need to coordinate orders to avoid overstock and stockouts, and they plan to maintain their order quantity at 20 units based on their expected demand of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our orders to better manage inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will place an order of 40 units to prepare for anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer to mitigate potential fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning orders based on shared demand forecasts will help us manage inventory efficiently.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly communication channel to share demand forecasts and adjust orders accordingly.
  Information Shared: My current inventory is 82 units with no backlog, and I expect a demand of 40 units in the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to maintain their order quantity at 20 units based on their expected demand of 20 units. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 40 units to prepare for anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the Retailer is focused on balancing their inventory, the Wholesaler's larger order may lead to excess inventory upstream if we are not aligned. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to ensure I can meet anticipated demand while avoiding overstock, and I encourage everyone to consider adjusting their orders based on shared demand insights to optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Maintaining order quantities aligned with expected demand while avoiding overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 62 units in inventory with no backlog, and I expect demand to be around 20 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they need to coordinate orders to avoid overstock and stockouts, and the Wholesaler plans to place an order of 40 units for anticipated demand. The Distributor also mentioned maintaining an order of 20 units to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to ensure we do not cause excess inventory upstream while meeting our demands. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units, as I expect consistent demand and want to avoid overstock while still being prepared for fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: Let's align our orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose regular communication on demand forecasts to coordinate our orders better and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 42 units in inventory and no backlog, and I expect demand to be around 20 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler said they will place an order of 40 units to prepare for anticipated demand, and the Distributor mentioned maintaining an order of 20 units to avoid overstock. I also hear the Factory plans to maintain their order of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all trying to align our orders, the Wholesaler's larger order could lead to excess inventory upstream if demand does not materialize as expected. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units, as I believe it will help us avoid overstock while meeting anticipated demand.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to keep a balanced inventory while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 102 units in inventory and no backlog, with an expected demand of 20 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order of 20 units to avoid excess stock, and the Distributor and Factory also plan to keep their orders at 20 units. I acknowledge the concern about the Wholesaler's larger order potentially leading to excess inventory upstream. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are aligned to prevent overstock while still meeting anticipated demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 40 units to prepare for the expected demand in the next round, while keeping a close watch on inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Aligning orders to expected demand will help us manage inventory efficiently.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a shared platform for weekly demand forecasts to coordinate our orders more effectively and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 82 units in inventory with no backlog, and I expect demand to be 40 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they plan to maintain their order of 20 units to avoid excess stock, and the Wholesaler acknowledged the concern about their larger order potentially leading to excess inventory. I also hear the Factory intends to keep their order at 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all trying to align our orders, the Wholesaler's order of 40 units may still create excess inventory upstream if demand doesn't meet expectations. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity of 20 units to keep a balance between meeting demand and avoiding overstock.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on maintaining order quantities aligned with expected demand while avoiding overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we implement a shared platform for weekly demand forecasts to better coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: I currently have 62 units in inventory with no backlog and expect demand to be around 20 units for the next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order of 20 units to avoid excess stock, and the Wholesaler mentioned they are maintaining their order of 40 units despite the risk of excess inventory. The Distributor also reiterated the importance of aligning orders to avoid overstock. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to meet demand, the Wholesaler's larger order may still create excess inventory if demand does not match expectations. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to align with the expected demand while minimizing the risk of overstock.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 102, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 12, Profit: 60.00, Total Profit: -13.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=I will order to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer for fluctuations., risk_assessment=Risk of overstock if demand decreases; must balance inventory and demand., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=102, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[6, 12], llm_incoming=[32], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [32]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order of 20 units to avoid excess stock, and the Wholesaler mentioned they are maintaining their order of 40 units despite the risk of excess inventory. The Distributor also reiterated the importance of aligning orders to avoid overstock. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to meet demand, the Wholesaler's larger order may still create excess inventory if demand does not match expectations. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to align with the expected demand while minimizing the risk of overstock.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 62 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 32]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [72]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I will place an order to maintain a buffer against potential demand increases while minimizing holding costs.",

          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [6, 52]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "Current inventory is adequate, and I expect consistent demand. I will order to cover potential demand while avoiding excess inventory.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they plan to maintain their order quantity at 20 units based on their expected demand of 20 units. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned they will place an order of 40 units to prepare for anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer. Based on this, my conclusion is that while the Retailer is focused on balancing their inventory, the Wholesaler's larger order may lead to excess inventory upstream if we are not aligned. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to ensure I can meet anticipated demand while avoiding overstock, and I encourage everyone to consider adjusting their orders based on shared demand insights to optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we share our demand forecasts weekly to coordinate our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they need to coordinate orders to avoid overstock and stockouts, and the Wholesaler plans to place an order of 40 units for anticipated demand. The Distributor also mentioned maintaining an order of 20 units to meet expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all align our orders to ensure we do not cause excess inventory upstream while meeting our demands. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units, as I expect consistent demand and want to avoid overstock while still being prepared for fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose regular communication on demand forecasts to coordinate our orders better and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said they will place an order of 40 units to prepare for anticipated demand, and the Distributor mentioned maintaining an order of 20 units to avoid overstock. I also hear the Factory plans to maintain their order of 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are all trying to align our orders, the Wholesaler's larger order could lead to excess inventory upstream if demand does not materialize as expected. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units, as I believe it will help us avoid overstock while meeting anticipated demand.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform for weekly demand forecasts to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order of 20 units to avoid excess stock, and the Distributor and Factory also plan to keep their orders at 20 units. I acknowledge the concern about the Wholesaler's larger order potentially leading to excess inventory upstream. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are aligned to prevent overstock while still meeting anticipated demand. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 40 units to prepare for the expected demand in the next round, while keeping a close watch on inventory levels across the supply chain.

The Distributor also reiterated the importance of aligning orders to avoid overstock. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to meet demand, the Wholesaler's larger order may still create excess inventory if demand does not match expectations. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to align with the expected demand while minimizing the risk of overstock.
