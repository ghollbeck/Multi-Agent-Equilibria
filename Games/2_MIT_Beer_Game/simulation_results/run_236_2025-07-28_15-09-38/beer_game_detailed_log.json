Given the recent demand of 10 units, I plan to produce 15-20 units this round to build up some safety stock and meet future demand. I suggest we all aim for a shared target inventory level of 10-15 units across the supply chain to balance costs and customer service. Based on the Wholesaler's and Distributor's messages, it seems we are all aligned on the need to coordinate production and inventory levels. Therefore, I propose we work together to smooth out the demand fluctuations and keep the supply chain stable. This will benefit all of us in the long run.",

I hear the Retailer proposed a combined target inventory of 50-70 units across the supply chain to balance supply and demand. I agree this is a reasonable approach, and I'm willing to coordinate my production to support this target range.
