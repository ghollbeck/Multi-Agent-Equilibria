Additionally, the Distributor has 4 units in inventory and no backlog, and they plan to order 20 units to build inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our efforts to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain to avoid stockouts. My current inventory is 0 units and I have a backlog of 30 units. Last round, I made a profit of -75.0.

My general ordering approach is to maintain a buffer to avoid stockouts while being mindful of holding costs. Therefore, I plan to order 10 units this round to align with the observed demand and maintain a safety stock. I propose that we all aim to keep our inventories at a level that can cover at least 3 rounds of expected demand, which would be around 30 units collectively across the supply chain.
