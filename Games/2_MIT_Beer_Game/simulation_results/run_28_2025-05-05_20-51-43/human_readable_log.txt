--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 8
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 42, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: 19.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.8, rationale=To maintain a buffer for potential fluctuations in demand while ensuring we do not overstock., risk_assessment=Fluctuating demand may lead to either stockouts or excess inventory, impacting costs., expected_demand_next_round=10
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [8]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 40 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
