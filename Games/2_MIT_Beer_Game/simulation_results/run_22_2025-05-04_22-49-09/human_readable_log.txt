--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 43, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 7, Profit: 35.00, Total Profit: 13.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.85, rationale=Ordering 10 units maintains a buffer against demand while minimizing holding costs., risk_assessment=There is a moderate risk of not meeting demand if it increases unexpectedly., expected_demand_next_round=12
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 43 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [10, 7, 10, 40]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 48, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 15, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 266.0

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 48 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [4, 14, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 15
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
