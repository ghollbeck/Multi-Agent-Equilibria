--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I currently have 101 units in inventory and no backlog. I am anticipating a demand of 20 units for the next round. I believe maintaining open communication about demand fluctuations will help us all manage our inventories better and avoid overstock or stockouts. I hear there may be concerns regarding demand forecasting from previous rounds, and I understand that accurate predictions are key to our success. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should share our demand forecasts more regularly to better align our orders across the supply chain. Therefore, I will continue to monitor my inventory closely and adjust my orders based on shared insights.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on balancing inventory while anticipating demand without over-ordering.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share demand forecasts and inventory levels.
  Information Shared: I am currently holding 101 units in inventory and expect a demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned that they have 101 units in inventory and are anticipating a demand of 20 units for the next round. I appreciate their emphasis on maintaining open communication about demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our orders to avoid stockouts and overstocking across the supply chain. Therefore, I will monitor my inventory closely and place an order of 20 units to ensure we meet the expected demand while keeping a buffer.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders based on shared demand forecasts to optimize inventory across the supply chain.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication channel to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels more frequently.

Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both plan to order 20 units to align with the expected demand of 20 units next round. However, I also note that the Factory anticipates a higher demand of 30 units and will order accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we have a consensus on the expected demand, it is crucial to be cautious about potential discrepancies between our orders and actual production capacity. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to match the anticipated demand while keeping a close watch on inventory levels and adjusting if necessary.
  Strategy Hint: Focus on aligning orders with anticipated demand while monitoring supply chain dynamics.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we create a shared schedule for regular updates on our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our efforts and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently hold 101 units in inventory, expect a demand of 20 units next round, and will place an order of 20 units.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned their cautious approach to the anticipated demand of 20 units and their intention to adjust if necessary. Additionally, the Factory indicated a higher anticipated demand of 30 units, which could lead to discrepancies in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we have a general consensus on demand, we must remain vigilant about potential discrepancies that could impact inventory levels across the board. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to align with the expected demand while keeping a close watch on my inventory levels and the overall dynamics within the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with shared demand insights while being mindful of potential discrepancies.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we formalize a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently hold 101 units in inventory and plan to order 20 units for the next round to meet anticipated demand.

Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned their cautious approach to the anticipated demand of 20 units and their intention to adjust if necessary. Additionally, the Wholesaler emphasized the importance of aligning orders with shared demand insights while being mindful of potential discrepancies. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we are generally aligned on the expected demand, the Factory's higher anticipated demand of 30 units could create challenges in our supply chain coordination. Therefore, I will place my order of 20 units to meet the expected demand while keeping a close watch on my inventory levels to avoid excess.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with shared demand insights while remaining vigilant about potential discrepancies.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 101, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -5.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.8, rationale=I have enough inventory to meet expected demand while avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Potential discrepancies in demand forecasts could lead to stockouts or overstock., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=101, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9], llm_incoming=[9], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

I also heard the Wholesaler mention a similar demand expectation and their intention to order 20 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all have a common understanding of the upcoming demand, which is crucial for our coordination. Therefore, I will place an order of 20 units to align with the expected demand while keeping an eye on my inventory levels to avoid excess.
  Proposal: I propose we formalize our communication regarding demand forecasts and inventory levels on a regular basis to enhance our collaboration.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they expect a demand of 20 units for the next round, and the Wholesaler and Distributor also plan to order 20 units to align with this expectation. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all have a common understanding of the expected demand, which is a positive sign for our coordination. However, I have noticed that my own anticipated demand for the next round is higher at 30 units. Therefore, I will place an order of 30 units to ensure I have sufficient inventory to meet this demand while avoiding stockouts.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared platform to regularly update and discuss our demand forecasts and inventory levels.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler and Distributor both plan to order 20 units to align with the expected demand of 20 units next round. However, I also note that the Factory anticipates a higher demand of 30 units and will order accordingly. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we have a consensus on the expected demand, it is crucial to be cautious about potential discrepancies between our orders and actual production capacity. Therefore, I will maintain my order of 20 units to match the anticipated demand while keeping a close watch on inventory levels and adjusting if necessary.
  Proposal: I propose we create a shared schedule for regular updates on our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our efforts and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer mentioned their cautious approach to the anticipated demand of 20 units and their intention to adjust if necessary. Additionally, the Factory indicated a higher anticipated demand of 30 units, which could lead to discrepancies in our supply chain. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we have a general consensus on demand, we must remain vigilant about potential discrepancies that could impact inventory levels across the board.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."

        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "Current inventory is sufficient to meet expected demand, ensuring no backlog and minimal holding costs.",

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 101 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [9]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 102 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they observed a consistent demand of 9 units and proposed we coordinate orders to minimize the bullwhip effect. I also note the Wholesaler agrees on the importance of collaboration and maintaining inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should enhance our communication to align our expectations and inventory levels effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units while monitoring demand trends closely and suggest we all agree on a regular update schedule to share our forecasts.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update to share our inventory levels and anticipated demand more effectively.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they have observed a consistent demand of 9 units and proposed coordinating orders to avoid overreacting to demand fluctuations. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor agree on the importance of collaboration. Based on this, my conclusion is that maintaining a stable inventory while sharing forecasts will help us all manage demand effectively. Therefore, I will continue with my order quantity of 30 units to balance my inventory while considering the recent spike in orders. I propose we align our order quantities to better respond to fluctuations and minimize the bullwhip effect.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 62 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 29]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [69]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 42 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I can handle expected demand while avoiding stockouts.",

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 98, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 13, Profit: 65.00, Total Profit: 4.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.75, rationale=I need to ensure sufficient inventory to cover expected demand while avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Stockouts may occur if demand exceeds expectations, but current inventory offers a buffer., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=98, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 9, 13], llm_incoming=[33], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 98 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 9, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said we need to improve our communication regarding demand trends to mitigate the bullwhip effect. I also note that the Wholesaler is aligned with this need. Based on this, my conclusion is that better forecasting and communication can help us all manage our inventories more effectively. Therefore, I will maintain my current inventory of 18 units, place an order of 20 units to align with expected demand, and suggest we share updated demand forecasts weekly to ensure we are all on the same page.
  Proposal: Let's implement a weekly sharing of demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination.

        You can now send a message to all other agents before this round's order decisions.
        Your goal is to share information that helps everyone optimize the supply chain while
        still maximizing your own profit.
        
        IMPORTANT: If other agents have spoken before you in this round, you MUST:
        1. Reflect on what they specifically said and how it affects you
        2. React by mentioning what you heard: "I hear [Agent X] said [specific point]..."
        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 18 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 29, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [73]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 8 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 49, 53]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I can handle expected demand while avoiding stockouts.",

          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 118, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: -9.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.85, rationale=With sufficient inventory and no backlog, I aim to fulfill expected demand while maintaining a buffer., risk_assessment=Demand fluctuations may lead to stockouts if not carefully monitored., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=118, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 13, 9], llm_incoming=[29], llm_last_order=20
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 118 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [29]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they will continue to monitor their inventory closely and place their next order based on anticipated demand while being cautious of potential fluctuations. I also hear Wholesaler emphasized the importance of closely monitoring inventory levels and aligning orders to cover expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to maintain clear communication regarding our inventory and demand forecasts to avoid stockouts or excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 20 units to balance my inventory while preparing for potential demand fluctuations, and I encourage you all to consider similar strategies.
  Proposal: Let's establish a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to better align our orders and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said they will monitor inventory closely and place orders based on anticipated demand fluctuations. I also hear Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of aligning orders to cover expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all facing similar challenges with fluctuating demand.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 18 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [49, 53, 49]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [49]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler mentioned concerns about fluctuating demand impacting their inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we must coordinate our orders to mitigate the bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will maintain my current order quantity of 20 units to ensure I can meet anticipated demand while keeping inventory levels manageable.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my inventory and avoid over-ordering based on recent demand patterns.
  Collaboration Proposal: I suggest we share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to better align our orders and reduce excess stock.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 138 units in inventory and no backlog, with an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their current order quantity of 20 units to meet anticipated demand while keeping inventory levels manageable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are aligned to avoid excess stock and backlogs in our supply chain. Therefore, I will also place an order for 20 units to keep our inventory levels stable and ready for demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to maintain inventory levels that can meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we continue to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect in our supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 98 units in inventory, no backlog, and an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their current order quantity of 20 units to ensure manageable inventory levels. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to place an order for 20 units to keep their inventory stable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning our orders to meet anticipated demand while managing inventory, which is positive. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units as well to ensure I can meet the expected demand while avoiding excess stock. Additionally, I suggest we maintain open lines of communication regarding any changes in demand to further mitigate the bullwhip effect in our supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order quantity with expected demand while keeping an eye on inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let’s agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory updates regularly to optimize our order quantities.

  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their current order quantity of 20 units to ensure manageable inventory levels. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to place an order for 20 units to keep their inventory stable, and the Distributor has agreed to do the same. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning our orders to meet anticipated demand while managing inventory effectively. However, given my higher inventory of 18 units and recent demand averaging around 51 units, I will adjust my order to 30 units to better prepare for the potential fluctuations in demand we might face in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units this round.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to proactively adjust my order based on observed demand patterns to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree to share our updated demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders effectively.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 18 units in inventory, a backlog of 0 units, and I expect demand to be around 30 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Factory said they will place an order for 30 units this round based on their higher inventory and observed demand patterns. This indicates a proactive approach to potential demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain aligned in our orders to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to balance my inventory with anticipated demand while being mindful of the Factory's larger order.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to balance my order quantity with expected demand while avoiding overstock.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 138 units in inventory and an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 20 units, while the Factory plans to order 30 units based on higher inventory and observed demand patterns. This indicates a proactive approach to managing potential fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are aligned to avoid excess stock and backlogs. Therefore, I will also place an order for 20 units to keep our inventory stable and ready for demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to maintain inventory levels that can meet expected demand while avoiding excess stock.

Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 20 units to balance inventory with anticipated demand. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to place an order for 20 units to keep their inventory stable. Furthermore, the Factory indicated they will order 30 units based on their observed demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to align our orders, the Factory's larger order may impact our overall supply chain dynamics. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 30 units to ensure I can meet potential demand fluctuations and avoid stockouts, while still maintaining manageable inventory levels.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to proactively align my order with observed demand trends while ensuring optimal inventory levels.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's commit to sharing our updated demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to enhance coordination and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 20 units to balance inventory with anticipated demand, while the Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 20 and 30 units respectively to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aiming to align our orders but may face challenges if demand exceeds expectations. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units this round to ensure I can meet demand fluctuations while maintaining a manageable inventory level.
  Strategy Hint: I aim to proactively adjust my order based on observed demand patterns to avoid stockouts.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's continue to share our updated demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders effectively and mitigate the bullwhip effect.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 138, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 13, Profit: 65.00, Total Profit: -13.5
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 138 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 9, 13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [33]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

I also note that the Wholesaler plans to place an order for 20 units to keep their inventory stable, and the Distributor has agreed to do the same. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning our orders to meet anticipated demand while managing inventory effectively. However, given my higher inventory of 18 units and recent demand averaging around 51 units, I will adjust my order to 30 units to better prepare for the potential fluctuations in demand we might face in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units this round.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our updated demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders effectively.
- Retailer: I hear the Factory said they will place an order for 30 units this round based on their higher inventory and observed demand patterns. This indicates a proactive approach to potential demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain aligned in our orders to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to balance my inventory with anticipated demand while being mindful of the Factory's larger order.
  Proposal: Let's continue sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 20 units, while the Factory plans to order 30 units based on higher inventory and observed demand patterns. This indicates a proactive approach to managing potential fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure our orders are aligned to avoid excess stock and backlogs. Therefore, I will also place an order for 20 units to keep our inventory stable and ready for demand fluctuations.
  Proposal: I propose we continue to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to enhance our coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect in our supply chain.

Furthermore, the Factory indicated they will order 30 units based on their observed demand patterns. Based on this, my conclusion is that while we all aim to align our orders, the Factory's larger order may impact our overall supply chain dynamics. Therefore, I will adjust my order to 30 units to ensure I can meet potential demand fluctuations and avoid stockouts, while still maintaining manageable inventory levels.

- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 20 units to balance inventory with anticipated demand, while the Wholesaler and Distributor plan to order 20 and 30 units respectively to manage inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aiming to align our orders but may face challenges if demand exceeds expectations. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units this round to ensure I can meet demand fluctuations while maintaining a manageable inventory level.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 58 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [33, 29, 33]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [83]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "Current inventory is sufficient to meet expected demand, ensuring no backlog and minimal holding costs.",

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 18 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [53, 49, 53]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [53]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I can handle expected demand while avoiding stockouts.",

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their current order quantity of 20 units to ensure manageable inventory levels. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to place an order for 20 units to keep their inventory stable. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning our orders to meet anticipated demand while managing inventory, which is positive. Therefore, I will place an order for 20 units as well to ensure I can meet the expected demand while avoiding excess stock. Additionally, I suggest we maintain open lines of communication regarding any changes in demand to further mitigate the bullwhip effect in our supply chain.
  Proposal: Let’s agree to share our demand forecasts and inventory updates regularly to optimize our order quantities.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their current order quantity of 20 units to ensure manageable inventory levels. I also note that the Wholesaler plans to place an order for 20 units to keep their inventory stable, and the Distributor has agreed to do the same. Based on this, my conclusion is that we are all aligning our orders to meet anticipated demand while managing inventory effectively. However, given my higher inventory of 18 units and recent demand averaging around 51 units, I will adjust my order to 30 units to better prepare for the potential fluctuations in demand we might face in the upcoming rounds. Therefore, I will place an order for 30 units this round.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our updated demand forecasts and inventory levels regularly to align our orders effectively.
- Retailer: I hear the Factory said they will place an order for 30 units this round based on their higher inventory and observed demand patterns. This indicates a proactive approach to potential demand fluctuations. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all remain aligned in our orders to avoid excess stock and potential stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain my order quantity at 20 units to balance my inventory with anticipated demand while being mindful of the Factory's larger order.
  Proposal: Let's continue sharing our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance coordination and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: I hear the Retailer said they will maintain their order quantity at 20 units, while the Factory plans to order 30 units based on higher inventory and observed demand patterns.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear no previous messages from other agents this round, so I want to proactively share my observations. Based on recent demand patterns, I've seen fluctuating orders with a recent average of about 10 units. My inventory stands at 157 units with no backlog, which suggests I can accommodate short-term demand spikes without immediate risk. However, I'm concerned about potential overstock. Therefore, I propose that we closely monitor demand trends and adjust our orders collaboratively to reduce the bullwhip effect. By sharing demand forecasts and adjusting our orders based on collective insights, we can optimize our inventory levels across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: I'm focusing on maintaining a balanced inventory while anticipating demand changes.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication schedule to review demand forecasts and order adjustments.
  Information Shared: I currently have 157 units in inventory and no backlog, with an expected demand of 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about potential overstock and proposed we monitor demand trends collaboratively. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should coordinate our orders to better align with actual demand and reduce excess inventory. Therefore, I will share my recent order patterns and expected demand, as I believe it will help us all adjust our strategies effectively.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 157, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: -42.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.85, rationale=I have sufficient inventory to meet expected demand and avoid stockouts, while still being cautious about overstock., risk_assessment=Demand may fluctuate unexpectedly, leading to potential overstock or stockouts., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=157, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[9, 13, 10], llm_incoming=[20], llm_last_order=10
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 157 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9, 13, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said they are concerned about potential overstock and proposed that we monitor demand trends collaboratively. I also hear Wholesaler echoing this sentiment about coordinating orders to align with actual demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to enhance our communication to avoid excess inventory and ensure we meet demand effectively. Therefore, I will suggest we establish a regular communication schedule to review demand forecasts and coordinate our orders, which will benefit all parties involved.
  Proposal: Let's set up a bi-weekly meeting to share our demand forecasts and order adjustments.
- Factory: I hear Retailer mentioned concerns about potential overstock and proposed collaborative monitoring of demand trends. I also hear Wholesaler agreeing on the need to coordinate orders to align with actual demand. Additionally, Distributor suggested enhancing communication to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all share a common goal of optimizing our inventory levels while responding effectively to demand. Therefore, I will propose we coordinate our order quantities based on collective demand insights to prevent overstock and stockouts, especially since my inventory is currently at 57 units with an expected demand of 30 units next round.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 57 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [49, 53, 30]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 55
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I can handle expected demand while avoiding stockouts.",
  "risk_assessment": "Demand may increase unexpectedly, leading to potential backlog if not enough inventory is maintained.",

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 180 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [20]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 10
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 160 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Wholesaler",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their next order to account for anticipated demand and maintain sufficient inventory. I also hear the Wholesaler mentioned maintaining their order quantity at 20 units to meet potential demand increases. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should all be mindful of the potential demand spike, but we need to avoid overcommitting to orders that could lead to excess inventory. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 20 units next round to align with expected demand while keeping my inventory levels manageable.
  Proposal: I propose we set up a regular schedule for sharing our demand forecasts to help align our strategies and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Factory: I hear the Retailer said they will adjust their next order to prepare for a potential demand spike. I also note the Wholesaler and Distributor are maintaining their order quantities at 20 units to align with expected demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that while demand may indeed increase, I must ensure I have sufficient inventory to meet both current and anticipated demand without risking stockouts. Therefore, I will place an order of 30 units next round to bolster my inventory in anticipation of heightened demand and to support the entire supply chain's needs.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular update on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to align our strategies and minimize the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I hear the Wholesaler said they need to align strategies to avoid excess stock or shortages and will maintain their order quantity at 20 units next round. I also hear the Distributor emphasized the need to avoid overcommitting to orders while preparing for demand spikes. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all recognize the potential for increased demand, but it is crucial to coordinate our order quantities to prevent excess inventory.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Init Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 105 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [53, 30, 40]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [40]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I can handle expected demand while avoiding stockouts.",

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 190 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [30]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 160 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 20
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I hear Retailer said that we should closely monitor inventory levels to ensure alignment with demand. I also hear Wholesaler mentioned the importance of coordinating our orders to avoid excess inventory. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to stay informed about each other's inventory and expected demand to prevent stockouts and overstocking. Therefore, I will maintain my current order of 20 units in anticipation of the expected demand of 20 units next round, while also suggesting we enhance our communication regarding inventory levels.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular cadence for sharing inventory levels and demand forecasts to streamline our ordering processes and mitigate the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I hear Retailer said we should closely monitor inventory levels to prevent stockouts and overstock. I also heard Wholesaler and Distributor emphasize the importance of coordinating our orders to align with anticipated demand. Based on this, my conclusion is that we all need to maintain open communication about our inventory levels and expected demands to optimize our ordering processes. Therefore, I will place an order of 30 units to maintain a healthy inventory while being responsive to the expected demand of 30 units next round.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 95 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [30, 40, 50]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [50]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "rationale": "With 100 units in inventory and no backlog, I can handle expected demand while avoiding stockouts.",

          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 202, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 8, Profit: 40.00, Total Profit: -188.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.9, rationale=To meet expected demand and maintain a buffer while avoiding stockouts., risk_assessment=Potential fluctuations in demand could lead to stockouts if not addressed., expected_demand_next_round=28, llm_inventory=202, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10, 10, 8], llm_incoming=[38], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 202 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 10, 8]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [38]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        3. State your conclusion and response: "Based on this, my conclusion is..."
        4. Explain how you will react: "Therefore, I will..."
        
        Consider sharing:
        - What demand patterns or trends you've observed
        - Suggestions for coordination to reduce bullwhip effect
        - Your capacity constraints or inventory situation
        - Proposals for information sharing or collaboration
        - Strategic hints that benefit everyone (including yourself)
        - Your specific reactions to what other agents have shared

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 87 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [40, 50, 58]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [58]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 40
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I hear that the wholesaler mentioned they are experiencing fluctuations in demand which could affect their inventory levels. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate more closely to avoid overstock or stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will monitor my inventory levels closely and adjust my order quantities to align with the anticipated demand while ensuring that we have enough supply to meet fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I plan to order based on a balanced approach to inventory and expected demand.
  Collaboration Proposal: I propose we establish a shared forecast model to better predict demand and align our orders across the supply chain.
  Information Shared: Currently, I have 221 units in inventory and expect a demand of around 20 units next round.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 221, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 20, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: -243.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=20, confidence=0.75, rationale=With sufficient inventory and recent demand trends, I aim to maintain a buffer while fulfilling expected demand., risk_assessment=Potential fluctuations in demand could lead to either overstock or stockouts if not monitored closely., expected_demand_next_round=29, llm_inventory=221, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10, 8, 11], llm_incoming=[41], llm_last_order=30
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 221 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 8, 11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [41]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:

          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 86 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [50, 58, 61]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [61]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Factory",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 100,
          "backlog": 0,
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,
          "rationale": "<brief explanation of your reasoning>",
          "risk_assessment": "<describe any risks you anticipate>",
          "expected_demand_next_round": <integer>,
          "order_quantity": <integer>
        }

        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no markdown, no triple backticks, no code fences, and do NOT write the word 'json' anywhere. Your reply must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else. If you include anything else, your answer will be rejected. KEEP IT RATHER SHORT
