Based on recent demand patterns, I observed a mean demand of approximately 10.5 units. My general ordering approach is to increase my order quantity to clear the backlog while ensuring I maintain a buffer for future demand. Therefore, I plan to order 15 units this round to address the backlog and prepare for potential future demand spikes. I propose that we coordinate our orders to ensure we maintain sufficient inventory across the supply chain, aiming for a target of at least 3 times the mean demand as a buffer. This will help us avoid stockouts and stabilize our operations. I encourage everyone to share their inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance our collective planning.",
