        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 40 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields:

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 50 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [33, 1, 6]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [69]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.
        
        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "order_quantity": 10,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "rationale": "With 40 units in inventory and expected demand of 12 units next round, ordering 10 units helps maintain balance and cushion against potential demand fluctuations.",
  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of overestimating demand, leading to excess inventory, or underestimating, resulting in backlog costs if demand increases unexpectedly.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12
}

        Given this state, how many units do you order from your upstream supplier 
        **this round**? Return valid JSON with:
