My current inventory is 0 units, and I have a backlog of 4 units. Last round, I made a profit of -5.0.

My general ordering approach is to maintain a buffer to avoid stockouts while being mindful of holding costs. Therefore, I plan to order 15 units this round to ensure I can meet potential demand spikes while keeping my inventory levels healthy. I suggest we aim for a collective target of maintaining enough inventory to cover at least 3 rounds of expected demand across the supply chain.

Therefore, I plan to order 15 units this round to ensure I can meet potential demand spikes while keeping my inventory healthy.

Currently, I have 0 units in inventory and 5 units in backlog, and I made a loss of 12.5 last round.

My current inventory is 0 units and I have a backlog of 19 units. Last round, I made a profit of 12.5.
