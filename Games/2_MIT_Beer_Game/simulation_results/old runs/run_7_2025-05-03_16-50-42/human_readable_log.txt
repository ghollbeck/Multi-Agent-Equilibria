--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 15
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 0, Backlog: 3, Order placed: 12, Total Cost: 3.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=12, confidence=0.85, rationale=Considering the backlog and recent demand, a slightly higher order aligns with expected needs for the next rounds., risk_assessment=Risk of continued backlog if demand increases further; however, overstock risk is mitigated by current low inventory., expected_demand_next_round=12
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0
          - Backlog: 3
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [15]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "order_quantity": 10,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "rationale": "Based on observed demand trends, a stable order quantity minimizes fluctuations and aligns with average demand while keeping costs manageable.",
  "risk_assessment": "Potential risks include underestimating demand leading to backlogs or overestimating leading to excess inventory.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12
}

        Given this state, how many units do you order from your upstream supplier 
        **this round**? Return valid JSON with:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
