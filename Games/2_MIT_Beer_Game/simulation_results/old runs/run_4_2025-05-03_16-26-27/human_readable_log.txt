--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 3, Backlog: 20, Order placed: 14, Total Cost: 1.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=14, confidence=0.9, rationale=With recent demand at 9 units and no incoming shipments, increasing the order to 14 units accounts for potential demand growth and maintains a buffer., risk_assessment=The primary risk is underestimating future demand, which could result in a backlog. Overordering remains a secondary risk, affecting holding costs., expected_demand_next_round=12
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 3
          - Backlog: 0
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Current Strategy:

  "expected_demand_next_round": 12

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain

          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
