--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 100, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 30, Units sold: 10, Profit: 50.00, Total Profit: 0.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=30, confidence=0.7, rationale=Placing an order for 30 units to meet expected demand while maintaining inventory buffer., risk_assessment=Risk of overestimating demand leading to excess inventory, and underestimating could result in backlog costs., expected_demand_next_round=30, llm_inventory=100, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[10], llm_incoming=[10], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Retailer",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "With an initial inventory of 100 units and no backlog, I can afford to place a moderate order to prepare for expected demand while avoiding excess holding costs.",
  "risk_assessment": "The primary risk is overestimating demand, which could lead to excess inventory and high holding costs. Additionally, underestimating demand could result in backlog costs.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 30,
  "order_quantity": 30
}

        

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: To all agents, I've noted the recent demand of 10 units and agree that we should prepare for an increase to 30 units next round. It's crucial that we align our orders to manage inventory effectively and avoid stockouts. Let's stay proactive in our communication.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly coordination meeting to share our forecasts and inventory levels, helping to reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've noted the recent demand of 10 units and agree with the expectation of an increase to 30 units next round. To avoid backlog and excess inventory, let's ensure our orders reflect this anticipated demand. Coordination is key.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a regular communication schedule to share our forecasts and inventory levels, which will help us coordinate our orders better.
- Retailer: I've noticed that we all anticipate an increase in demand next round. To avoid excess inventory and stockouts, aligning our orders will be crucial. Let's communicate our expected order quantities clearly.
  Proposal: I propose a shared document where we can update our demand forecasts and inventory levels weekly to enhance coordination.
- Wholesaler: I've observed a consistent demand of 10 units, with all agents anticipating an increase to around 30-40 units next round. To prevent excess inventory and stockouts, it's essential we align our orders and share forecasts regularly.
  Proposal: Let's create a shared document for our forecasts and inventory levels to improve our coordination efforts.
- Distributor: As we all anticipate an increase in demand to around 30 units next round, it's crucial that we coordinate our orders to avoid excess inventory and stockouts. Let's ensure our orders reflect this collective expectation.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a shared document for weekly updates on our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination efforts.
- Factory: I've observed a consistent demand of 10 units, and we all anticipate an increase to around 30 units next round. To manage our inventory effectively and avoid stockouts, it's crucial we align our orders and share forecasts regularly. Let's maintain open communication to adapt to any fluctuations in demand.
  Proposal: I recommend we establish a shared document for weekly updates on our demand forecasts and inventory levels to enhance our coordination efforts.

Consider this information when making your order decision. Look for opportunities to coordinate while optimizing your own performance.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 100 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 39 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10, 41]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [101]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 30
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "role_name": "Distributor",
  "inventory": 100,
  "backlog": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: I've noticed demand fluctuations recently, with orders fluctuating between 10 and 41 units. To optimize our supply chain and mitigate stockouts, I recommend we all adjust our order quantities based on these trends and maintain open communication regarding our inventory levels.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on our inventory and demand forecasts to better align our orders and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: I've observed the recent demand trends and noted the significant fluctuations between 10 and 71 units. To optimize our supply chain, I recommend we align our orders based on expected demand while maintaining sufficient inventory to handle potential spikes. Let's collaborate to ensure we avoid stockouts and minimize excess inventory.
  Proposal: I propose we establish a weekly communication channel to share our inventory levels and demand forecasts, ensuring we all stay aligned and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Retailer: I've observed that our recent demand trends are stabilizing around 10-11 units, but we should prepare for a potential increase next round. The Wholesaler anticipates a spike to 40 units, while the Distributor and Factory are aligned with a demand of 30 units. We need to adjust our orders accordingly to avoid stockouts while minimizing excess inventory across the supply chain.
  Proposal: I propose we synchronize our order schedules and share weekly updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance coordination.
- Wholesaler: I've observed that demand trends are stabilizing around 10-11 units, but I anticipate a spike to 40 units next round. It's crucial that we adjust our orders accordingly to prevent stockouts across the supply chain. Open communication about our inventory levels and expected demand is essential to minimize discrepancies and optimize our operations.
  Proposal: Let's synchronize our order schedules and share weekly updates on inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance coordination.
- Distributor: I've observed significant fluctuations in demand, with recent orders ranging from 10 to 41 units. To optimize our supply chain and mitigate risks of stockouts, I recommend we closely align our orders with the expected demand of around 30-40 units for the next round. This will help us maintain balance and reduce the bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
  Proposal: Let's establish a weekly update on our inventory levels and demand forecasts to enhance our coordination and minimize discrepancies.
- Factory: I've observed significant demand fluctuations recently, with orders ranging from 10 to 71 units.
