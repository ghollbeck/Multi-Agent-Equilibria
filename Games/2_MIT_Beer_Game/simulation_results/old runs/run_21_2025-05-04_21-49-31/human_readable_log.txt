--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 41, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 10, Units sold: 9, Profit: 45.00, Total Profit: 24.5
    LLM Output: order_quantity=10, confidence=0.85, rationale=Ordering 10 units maintains a buffer to cover expected demand while avoiding excess holding costs., risk_assessment=Risks include demand fluctuations leading to potential stockouts or increased holding costs if demand decreases., expected_demand_next_round=12
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 41 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 50
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

--------------------- Round 7 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 9
Shipments received per agent: [14, 9, 10, 50]

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 53 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13, 11, 9]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [18]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: 12
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next two rounds (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.
