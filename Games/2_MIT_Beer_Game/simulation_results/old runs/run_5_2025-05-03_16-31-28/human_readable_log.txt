--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 10
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 2, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 15, Total Cost: 1.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=15, confidence=0.9, rationale=To cover the consistent demand trend of 10 units and to buffer against any potential increase, the order quantity is set higher than the recent demand. This accounts for lead time and aims to prevent backlog., risk_assessment=The main risk is overordering, which could lead to excess inventory if the demand decreases unexpectedly., expected_demand_next_round=12
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 2
          - Backlog: 0
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [10]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "order_quantity": 12,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "rationale": "The order quantity is based on the observed demand of 12 units in the previous round. This approach aims to meet expected demand while minimizing holding and backlog costs.",
  "risk_assessment": "A risk is potential fluctuations in demand leading to either excess inventory or unmet demand, causing increased holding or backlog costs.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12
}

        Given this state, how many units do you order from your upstream supplier 
        **this round**? Return valid JSON with:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
