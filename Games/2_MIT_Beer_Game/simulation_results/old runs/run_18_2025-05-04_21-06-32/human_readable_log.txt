    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 27 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [13]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.
        
        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 40 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields:

        You are the Factory in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 78 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [27, 0, 12]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [13]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.
        
        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold

        Current Strategy:
        {
  "order_quantity": 10,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "rationale": "Ordering 10 units balances inventory needs and minimizes holding costs while anticipating increased demand.",
  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of overestimating demand, leading to excess inventory and holding costs, or underestimating, resulting in backlog costs.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12
}

        Given this state, how many units do you order from your upstream supplier 
        **this round**? Return valid JSON with:
