External demand (Retailer): 7
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]
Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 13, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 12, Units sold: 7, Profit: 10.50, Total Profit: 4.0

    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 13 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]
          - Profit per unit sold: $1.5

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.
        
        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $1.5 per unit sold

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 20 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $1.5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
          • You earn $1.5 profit for each unit sold

        Current State:
          - Inventory: 0 units
          - Backlog: 10 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [7, 13, 0]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [10]
          - Profit per unit sold: $1.5

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.
        
        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.0 per unfilled unit per round
          - Profit: $1.5 per unit sold
