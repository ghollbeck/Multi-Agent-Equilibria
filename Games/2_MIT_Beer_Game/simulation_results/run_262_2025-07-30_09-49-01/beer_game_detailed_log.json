I also hear the Wholesaler plans to order 70 units to address their backlog of 19 units and build a buffer for future demand. Additionally, the Distributor plans to order 70 units to clear their backlog of 65 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production to ensure we collectively maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production of 70 units this round to address my backlog of 70 units and prepare for future demand, while also considering the recent mean demand of approximately 10 units. I suggest we aim for a total of at least 100 units in production across the chain to ensure we have enough inventory to meet demand and avoid stockouts.",

Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to coordinate our production to ensure we collectively maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production of 70 units this round to address my backlog of 70 units and prepare for future demand, while also considering the recent mean demand of approximately 10 units.

Therefore, I plan to order 30 units this round to address my backlog and prepare for potential future demand spikes. I suggest that we coordinate our orders to ensure we collectively maintain sufficient inventory levels across the supply chain, aiming for a target of at least 3 times the mean demand as a buffer.
