I also hear the Wholesaler plans to order 60 units to align with the Retailer's needs, and the Distributor plans to order 70 units to clear their backlog of 10 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to ensure sufficient production to meet the collective demand and avoid stockouts across the supply chain. Therefore, I will schedule production of 70 units this round to help support the downstream needs and build a buffer for future demand fluctuations.",
