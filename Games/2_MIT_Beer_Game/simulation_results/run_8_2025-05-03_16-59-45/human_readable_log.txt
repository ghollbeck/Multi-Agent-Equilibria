External demand (Retailer): 14
Shipments received per agent: [0, 0, 0, 0]

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:

          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [14]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [0]

        Your known lead time is 2 rounds for any order you place.

  "risk_assessment": "There is a risk of over-ordering if demand fluctuates, leading to higher holding costs.",
  "expected_demand_next_round": 12
}

        Given this state, how many units do you order from your upstream supplier 
        **this round**? Return valid JSON with:

        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs) over multiple rounds.

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 2-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.0 per unit per round of unmet demand
