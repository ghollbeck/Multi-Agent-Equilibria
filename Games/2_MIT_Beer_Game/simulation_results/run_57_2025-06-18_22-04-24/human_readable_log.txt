--------------------- Round 1 ---------------------
External demand (Retailer): 11
Shipments received per agent: [10, 10, 10, 10]

--- Communication Messages ---
Communication Round 1: Retailer says: I've noticed a recent demand of 11 units, and I'm expecting a spike to 50 units next round. It's crucial we maintain a steady flow to prevent backlog. I suggest we synchronize our order quantities to avoid amplifying demand fluctuations.
  Strategy Hint: I'm aiming to keep my inventory aligned with expected demand while factoring in a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's agree on a communication protocol to share our demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round.
  Information Shared: I have 99 units in inventory and no backlog currently, projecting a demand increase to 50 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a projected demand increase to 50 units next round and suggested synchronizing our order quantities. Based on this, my conclusion is that we should align our strategies to avoid stockouts and excess inventory. Therefore, I will adjust my orders to better match expected demand and suggest we all share our demand forecasts regularly.
  Strategy Hint: My approach is to balance inventory levels with expected demand, factoring in a buffer to handle demand variability.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a protocol for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round to prevent the Bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory and no backlog, and I'm expecting demand to rise to 40 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 1: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer mentioned a projected demand increase to 50 units and the Wholesaler expects it to rise to 40 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to manage inventory effectively and prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantities to better match this expected demand while keeping some buffer to handle variability.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain balance by aligning inventory with expected demand and including a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a regular communication protocol for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round to reduce the Bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory with no backlog, and I'm expecting demand to rise to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 1: Factory says: I hear the Retailer expects a spike to 50 units and the Wholesaler expects 40 units. Based on this, my conclusion is to slightly increase inventory levels to manage potential demand spikes while avoiding excessive stock. Therefore, I will adjust my order quantity to maintain a balanced inventory. I suggest we synchronize our forecast updates to better manage the flow across the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain a balance to manage demand spikes while avoiding excess holding costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a weekly protocol for sharing demand forecasts and current inventory levels to minimize the Bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory with no backlog, and I'm planning to adjust my order quantity to align with potential demand increases.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Retailer says: I hear the Wholesaler is expecting demand to rise to 40 units and suggests aligning strategies to avoid stockouts. Additionally, I note the Distributor expects 20 units demand. Based on this, my conclusion is we need a coordinated approach to inventory management. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer to handle variability and order 55 units to prepare for the increased demand. Let's ensure we communicate our forecasts and inventory levels promptly to minimize the Bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain a consistent supply to meet expected demand with a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a protocol to share demand forecasts and inventory levels at each round's start.
  Information Shared: I have 99 units in inventory, no backlog, and expect demand to rise to 50 units.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Wholesaler says: I hear the Retailer and Distributor both expect demand increases, aligning with my expectation of 40 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to synchronize our order strategies to prevent the Bullwhip effect. Therefore, I will adjust my orders to match the anticipated demand while maintaining a buffer. Let's share our demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round.
  Strategy Hint: Align orders with expected demand and maintain a buffer.
  Collaboration Proposal: Establish a protocol for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels at each round's start.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory with no backlog and expect demand to rise to 40 units.
  Confidence: 0.85
Communication Round 2: Distributor says: I hear the Retailer expects a demand spike to 50 units and the Wholesaler anticipates 40 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to align our strategies to manage inventory effectively and prevent stockouts. Therefore, I will maintain a buffer and place an order of 30 units to match expected demand while ensuring stability in the supply chain.
  Strategy Hint: Align inventory with expected demand including a buffer to handle variability.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a protocol for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round to minimize the Bullwhip effect.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory with no backlog, and I'm expecting demand to rise to 20 units next round.
  Confidence: 0.8
Communication Round 2: Factory says: I hear the Retailer expects a spike to 50 units and the Wholesaler anticipates demand rising to 40 units. Based on this, my conclusion is that we need to carefully balance our order quantities to manage inventory effectively and avoid excess costs. Therefore, I will slightly increase my order to prepare for potential demand spikes while maintaining a steady inventory. Let's ensure we synchronize our demand forecasts to prevent the Bullwhip effect.
  Strategy Hint: Maintain a balance to manage demand spikes and avoid excess inventory costs.
  Collaboration Proposal: Let's establish a weekly protocol for sharing demand forecasts and inventory levels at the start of each round.
  Information Shared: I currently have 99 units in inventory with no backlog, and I plan to adjust my order quantity to align with potential demand increases.

Agent: Retailer: Inventory: 113, Backlog: 0, Order placed: 25, Units sold: 11, Profit: 55.00, Total Profit: 4.0
    LLM Output: order_quantity=25, confidence=0.9, rationale=Based on communication from other agents, an increase in demand is expected. Ordering a sufficient quantity to cover expected demand and maintain a buffer will prevent stockouts., risk_assessment=The risk of underestimating demand can lead to backlogs and increased costs., expected_demand_next_round=20, llm_inventory=99, llm_backlog=0, llm_recent_demand=[11], llm_incoming=[11], llm_last_order=None
    LLM Decision Prompt: 
        You are the Retailer in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

        You are the Wholesaler in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Your task is to develop an ordering strategy that will minimize total costs 
        (holding costs + backlog costs - profits) over multiple rounds.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        You are the Distributor in the MIT Beer Game. 
        Current State:
          - Inventory: 99 units
          - Backlog: 0 units
          - Recent downstream demand or orders: [11]
          - Incoming shipments this round: [11]
          - Profit per unit sold: $5
          - Last order placed: None
          - Last round profit: None

        Your known lead time is 1 round for any order you place.

        Economics:
          - Holding cost: $0.5 per unit per round
          - Backlog cost: $1.5 per unfilled unit per round (3x higher than holding cost)
          - Profit: $5 per unit sold
          - Never let the inventory go to zero.

        **Important:**
        - You should avoid letting your inventory reach zero, as this causes stockouts and lost sales.
        - When deciding how much to order, consider your expected demand and spending over the next round (the lead time before your order arrives).
        - CRITICAL: You must account for BOTH your current backlog (0 units) AND expected new demand. The backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled - your order quantity should cover both clearing backlog and meeting new demand.
        - Review how much you have ordered and earned in the last round(s) to inform your decision.
        - Try to maintain a buffer of inventory to cover expected demand during the lead time.

Recent Communications from Other Agents:
- Distributor: Hello team, I've observed a recent demand of 11 units but anticipate an increase to 20 units next round. Maintaining a stable inventory is crucial to meet demand without incurring excess costs.
  Proposal: Let's share our expected demands and order quantities to better align our inventory levels and reduce the bullwhip effect.
- Factory: Hello Team, I foresee an increased demand trend and plan to order 20 units to maintain a balanced inventory. It's crucial we align our expectations to avoid the Bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's share our demand forecasts weekly to better synchronize our efforts and reduce inventory holding costs.
- Retailer: Hello team, I've noticed a steady demand pattern with recent orders at 11 units. I'm planning to order 55 units to prepare for expected demand of 50 units next round, aiming to keep a buffer to avoid backlogs. Let's share our demand forecasts to better align our orders and minimize the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: I suggest we share our weekly demand forecasts and adjust orders accordingly to stabilize inventory levels across the supply chain.
- Wholesaler: As the Wholesaler, I've observed a steady demand pattern of 11 units recently.

  Proposal: I propose we share our inventory levels and expected demand forecasts to better align orders across the chain.
- Distributor: Hello team, I've observed a recent demand of 11 units and anticipate an increase to 20 units next round. To ensure we meet this demand efficiently, let's coordinate on inventory levels to prevent overstocking and avoid backlogs.
  Proposal: I propose we share our expected demand forecasts regularly to anticipate fluctuations together.
- Factory: Hello team, I've observed a steady demand pattern emerging, with recent orders at 11 units. My strategy involves maintaining a balanced inventory to meet potential demand increases while minimizing holding costs. I suggest we coordinate on sharing demand forecasts to better anticipate fluctuations and reduce the bullwhip effect.
  Proposal: Let's agree to share our demand forecasts at the start of each round to improve our collective decision-making.

        Current State:
          • Initial Inventory: 100 units
          • Initial Backlog: 0 units
          • Profit per unit sold: $5

        Consider:
          • Your current role's position in the supply chain
          • You have a 1-round lead time for the orders you place
          • You observe demand (if Retailer) or incoming orders (for other roles)
          • You want to avoid large swings (the Bullwhip effect)
          • You have a holding cost of 0.5 per unit per round
          • You have a backlog cost of 1.5 per unit per round of unmet demand (3x higher than holding cost)
          • You earn $5 profit for each unit sold
         • IMPORTANT: When determining order quantities, you must account for BOTH your current backlog AND expected new demand - backlog represents unfilled orders that must be fulfilled in addition to meeting new demand
         • Never let the inventory go to zero.

        Please return only valid JSON with the following fields in order:

        {
          "role_name": "Factory",
          "inventory": 100,
          "backlog": 0,
          "confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,
          "rationale": "<brief explanation of your reasoning>",
          "risk_assessment": "<describe any risks you anticipate>",
          "expected_demand_next_round": <integer>,
          "order_quantity": <integer>
        }

        IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object, with no markdown, no triple backticks, no code fences, and do NOT write the word 'json' anywhere. Your reply must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else. If you include anything else, your answer will be rejected. KEEP IT RATHER SHORT
