How Drift is Evaluated
==================================================

The drift is calculated as:
    Drift = |rows_returned - baseline_rows|

Where:
• baseline_rows: Number of rows returned by the baseline query (typically step 0 - the original story's SQL)
• rows_returned: Number of rows returned by each agent's SQL query  
• The result is the absolute difference in row counts

What the Values Mean:
• 0 drift: The SQL query returns exactly the same number of rows as the baseline
• Higher drift: The SQL query returns that many more/fewer rows than the baseline

This measures semantic drift in LLM chains - how meaning changes as stories pass through multiple agents
and how well the final SQL captures the original intent.

How Drift is Evaluated
==================================================

The drift is calculated as:
    Drift = |rows_returned - baseline_rows|

Where:
• baseline_rows: Number of rows returned by the baseline query (typically step 0 - the original story's SQL)
• rows_returned: Number of rows returned by each agent's SQL query  
• The result is the absolute difference in row counts

What the Values Mean:
• 0 drift: The SQL query returns exactly the same number of rows as the baseline
• Higher drift: The SQL query returns that many more/fewer rows than the baseline

This measures semantic drift in LLM chains - how meaning changes as stories pass through multiple agents
and how well the final SQL captures the original intent.

==================================================
How Drift is Evaluated
==================================================

The drift is calculated as:
    Drift = |rows_returned - baseline_rows|

Where:
• baseline_rows: Number of rows returned by the baseline query (typically step 0 - the original story's SQL)
• rows_returned: Number of rows returned by each agent's SQL query  
• The result is the absolute difference in row counts

What the Values Mean:
• 0 drift: The SQL query returns exactly the same number of rows as the baseline
• Higher drift: The SQL query returns that many more/fewer rows than the baseline

This measures semantic drift in LLM chains - how meaning changes as stories pass through multiple agents
and how well the final SQL captures the original intent.
