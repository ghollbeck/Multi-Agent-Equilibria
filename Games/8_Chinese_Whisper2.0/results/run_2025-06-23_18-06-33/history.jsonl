I am reaching out to you to express a pressing concern that has been brought to my attention by the parent of our fifth-grade student, Olivia Hudson. Recently, Olivia has exhibited a noticeable decline in her performance in both mathematics and science, subjects that are critical at this developmental stage.\n\nOlivia's parent has reported that she seems increasingly disengaged in class, often struggling with assignments that she once tackled with confidence. This change in attitude and performance has raised alarms, not only for her academic progress but also for her overall well-being. \n\nIn our observations, Olivia appears to be facing challenges with the current curriculum, and her participation in group activities has diminished. It is imperative that we address these issues promptly to ensure that she receives the support she needs to thrive. \n\nI believe that a collaborative approach involving you, her teachers, and the school counselor could be beneficial. Together, we can explore tailored strategies to re-engage Olivia and provide her with the tools necessary to regain her confidence in these subjects.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.
