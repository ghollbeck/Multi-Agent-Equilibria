- Template provided for future development tasks
- Searchable format established for LLM accessibility

**Usage Instructions:**
```bash
# Before starting any development task, always:
1. Read CURSOR_RULES.md sections 1-2 (Historical Awareness & Planning)
2. Follow sections 3-5 for implementation (Testing, Logging, Execution)
3. Update Readme_running.md using section 6 templates
4. Complete section 8 quality checklist before finishing
```

**Future Improvements:**
- Consider adding automated enforcement via pre-commit hooks
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automatic test running
- Add project-specific rule adaptations as new game types are developed
- Create abbreviated quick-reference version for experienced developers

**Searchable Keywords**: cursor_rules, development_practices, systematic_development, test_driven_development, comprehensive_logging, readme_running, historical_awareness, chain_of_thought_planning, quality_checklist, multi_agent_games, unit_testing, script_verification, performance_monitoring, error_handling, documentation_workflow, code_quality_metrics, LLM_integration_testing, game_simulation_logging
